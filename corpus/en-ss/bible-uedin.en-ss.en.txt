the book of the genealogy of jesus christ, the son of david, the son of abraham
abraham became the father of isaac
isaac became the father of jacob
jacob became the father of judah and his brothers
judah became the father of perez and zerah by tamar
perez became the father of hezron
hezron became the father of ram
ram became the father of amminadab
amminadab became the father of nahshon
nahshon became the father of salmon
salmon became the father of boaz by rahab
boaz became the father of obed by ruth
obed became the father of jesse
jesse became the father of king david
david became the father of solomon by her who had been the wife of uriah
solomon became the father of rehoboam
rehoboam became the father of abijah
abijah became the father of asa
asa became the father of jehoshaphat
jehoshaphat became the father of joram
joram became the father of uzziah
uzziah became the father of jotham
jotham became the father of ahaz
ahaz became the father of hezekiah
hezekiah became the father of manasseh
manasseh became the father of amon
amon became the father of josiah
josiah became the father of jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to babylon
after the exile to babylon, jechoniah became the father of shealtiel
shealtiel became the father of zerubbabel
zerubbabel became the father of abiud
abiud became the father of eliakim
eliakim became the father of azor
azor became the father of sadoc
sadoc became the father of achim
achim became the father of eliud
eliud became the father of eleazar
eleazar became the father of matthan
matthan became the father of jacob
jacob became the father of joseph, the husband of mary, from whom was born jesus, who is called christ
so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations; from david to the exile to babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to babylon to the christ, fourteen generations
now the birth of jesus christ was like this; for after his mother, mary, was engaged to joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the holy spirit
joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly
but when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, joseph, son of david, dont be afraid to take to yourself mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit
she shall bring forth a son
you shall call his name jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins
now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet, saying,
behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son
they shall call his name immanuel; which is, being interpreted, god with us
joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
and didnt know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son
he named him jesus
now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of king herod, behold, wise men from the east came to jerusalem, saying,
where is he who is born king of the jews? for we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him
when king herod heard it, he was troubled, and all jerusalem with him
gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the christ would be born
they said to him, in bethlehem of judea, for this is written through the prophet,
you bethlehem, land of judah, are in no way least among the princes of judah
for out of you shall come forth a governor, who shall shepherd my people, israel
then herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared
he sent them to bethlehem, and said, go and search diligently for the young child
when you have found him, bring me word, so that i also may come and worship him
they, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was
when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy
they came into the house and saw the young child with mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him
opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts
gold, frankincense, and myrrh
being warned in a dream that they shouldnt return to herod, they went back to their own country another way
now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream, saying, arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into egypt, and stay there until i tell you, for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into egypt,
and was there until the death of herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet, saying, out of egypt i called my son
then herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men
then that which was spoken by jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
a voice was heard in ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning, rachel weeping for her children; she wouldnt be comforted, because they are no more
but when herod was dead, behold, an angel of the lord appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt, saying,
arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead
he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of israel
but when he heard that archelaus was reigning over judea in the place of his father, herod, he was afraid to go there
being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of galilee,
and came and lived in a city called nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets
he will be called a nazarene
in those days, john the baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of judea, saying,
repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!
for this is he who was spoken of by isaiah the prophet, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the lord
make his paths straight
now john himself wore clothing made of camels hair, with a leather belt around his waist
his food was locusts and wild honey
then people from jerusalem, all of judea, and all the region around the jordan went out to him
they were baptized by him in the jordan, confessing their sins
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, you offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
dont think to yourselves, we have abraham for our father, for i tell you that god is able to raise up children to abraham from these stones
even now the axe lies at the root of the trees
therefore every tree that doesnt bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire
i indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than i, whose shoes i am not worthy to carry
he will baptize you in the holy spirit
his winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor
he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire
then jesus came from galilee to the jordan to john, to be baptized by him
but john would have hindered him, saying, i need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?
but jesus, answering, said to him, allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness
then he allowed him
jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water
and behold, the heavens were opened to him
he saw the spirit of god descending as a dove, and coming on him
behold, a voice out of the heavens said, this is my beloved son, with whom i am well pleased
then jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward
the tempter came and said to him, if you are the son of god, command that these stones become bread
but he answered, it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god
then the devil took him into the holy city
he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
and said to him, if you are the son of god, throw yourself down, for it is written, he will put his angels in charge of you
and, on their hands they will bear you up, so that you dont dash your foot against a stone
jesus said to him, again, it is written, you shall not test the lord, your god
again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory
he said to him, i will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me
then jesus said to him, get behind me, satan! for it is written, you shall worship the lord your god, and you shall serve him only
then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him
now when jesus heard that john was delivered up, he withdrew into galilee
leaving nazareth, he came and lived in capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of zebulun and naphtali,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet, saying,
the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali, toward the sea, beyond the jordan, galilee of the gentiles,
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, to them light has dawned
from that time, jesus began to preach, and to say, repent! for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
walking by the sea of galilee, he saw two brothers
simon, who is called peter, and andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen
he said to them, come after me, and i will make you fishers for men
they immediately left their nets and followed him
going on from there, he saw two other brothers, james the son of zebedee, and john his brother, in the boat with zebedee their father, mending their nets
he called them
they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him
jesus went about in all galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people
the report about him went out into all syria
they brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them
great multitudes from galilee, decapolis, jerusalem, judea and from beyond the jordan followed him
seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain
when he had sat down, his disciples came to him
he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted
blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled
blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy
blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see god
blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of god
blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake
rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven
for that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you
you are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? it is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men
you are the light of the world
a city located on a hill cant be hidden
neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house
even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your father who is in heaven
dont think that i came to destroy the law or the prophets
i didnt come to destroy, but to fulfill
for most certainly, i tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished
whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
for i tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the kingdom of heaven
you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, you shall not murder; and whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment
but i tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, raca ! shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, you fool! shall be in danger of the fire of gehenna
if therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,
leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way
first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift
agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison
most certainly i tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny
you have heard that it was said, you shall not commit adultery;
but i tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart
if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you
for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into gehenna
if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you
for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into gehenna
it was also said, whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,
but i tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery
again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, you shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the lord your vows,
but i tell you, dont swear at all
neither by heaven, for it is the throne of god;
nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king
neither shall you swear by your head, for you cant make one hair white or black
but let your yes be yes and your no be no
whatever is more than these is of the evil one
you have heard that it was said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth
but i tell you, dont resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also
if anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also
whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two
give to him who asks you, and dont turn away him who desires to borrow from you
you have heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy
but i tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,
that you may be children of your father who is in heaven
for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust
for if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? dont even the tax collectors do the same?
if you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? dont even the tax collectors do the same?
therefore you shall be perfect, just as your father in heaven is perfect
be careful that you dont do your charitable giving before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your father who is in heaven
therefore when you do merciful deeds, dont sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from men
most certainly i tell you, they have received their reward
but when you do merciful deeds, dont let your left hand know what your right hand does,
so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your father who sees in secret will reward you openly
when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men
most certainly, i tell you, they have received their reward
but you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your father who is in secret, and your father who sees in secret will reward you openly
in praying, dont use vain repetitions, as the gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking
therefore dont be like them, for your father knows what things you need, before you ask him
pray like this
our father in heaven, may your name be kept holy
let your kingdom come
let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth
give us today our daily bread
forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors
bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one
for yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever
amen
for if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also forgive you
but if you dont forgive men their trespasses, neither will your father forgive your trespasses
moreover when you fast, dont be like the hypocrites, with sad faces
for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting
most certainly i tell you, they have received their reward
but you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your father who is in secret, and your father, who sees in secret, will reward you
dont lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves dont break through and steal;
for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also
the lamp of the body is the eye
if therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light
but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness
if therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
no one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other
you cant serve both god and mammon
therefore i tell you, dont be anxious for your life
what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear
isnt life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
see the birds of the sky, that they dont sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns
your heavenly father feeds them
arent you of much more value than they?
which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan?
why are you anxious about clothing? consider the lilies of the field, how they grow
they dont toil, neither do they spin,
yet i tell you that even solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these
but if god so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, wont he much more clothe you, you of little faith?
therefore dont be anxious, saying, what will we eat?, what will we drink? or, with what will we be clothed?
for the gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things
but seek first gods kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well
therefore dont be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself
each days own evil is sufficient
dont judge, so that you wont be judged
for with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you
why do you see the speck that is in your brothers eye, but dont consider the beam that is in your own eye?
or how will you tell your brother, let me remove the speck from your eye; and behold, the beam is in your own eye?
you hypocrite! first remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brothers eye
dont give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces
ask, and it will be given you
seek, and you will find
knock, and it will be opened for you
for everyone who asks receives
he who seeks finds
to him who knocks it will be opened
or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?
if you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets
enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it
how narrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! few are those who find it
beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves
by their fruits you will know them
do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit
a good tree cant produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit
every tree that doesnt grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire
therefore by their fruits you will know them
not everyone who says to me, lord, lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
many will tell me in that day, lord, lord, didnt we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?
then i will tell them, i never knew you
depart from me, you who work iniquity
everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, i will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock
the rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didnt fall, for it was founded on the rock
everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesnt do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand
the rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell--and great was its fall
it happened, when jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,
for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes
when he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him
behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, lord, if you want to, you can make me clean
jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, i want to
be made clean
immediately his leprosy was cleansed
jesus said to him, see that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that moses commanded, as a testimony to them
when he came into capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,
and saying, lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented
jesus said to him, i will come and heal him
the centurion answered, lord, im not worthy for you to come under my roof
just say the word, and my servant will be healed
for i am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers
i tell this one, go, and he goes; and tell another, come, and he comes; and tell my servant, do this, and he does it
when jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, most certainly i tell you, i havent found so great a faith, not even in israel
i tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with abraham, isaac, and jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
but the children of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
jesus said to the centurion, go your way
let it be done for you as you have believed
his servant was healed in that hour
when jesus came into peters house, he saw his wifes mother lying sick with a fever
he touched her hand, and the fever left her
she got up and served him
when evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons
he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet, saying
he took our infirmities, and bore our diseases
now when jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side
a scribe came, and said to him, teacher, i will follow you wherever you go
jesus said to him, the foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head
another of his disciples said to him, lord, allow me first to go and bury my father
but jesus said to him, follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead
when he got into a boat, his disciples followed him
behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep
they came to him, and woke him up, saying, save us, lord! we are dying!
he said to them, why are you fearful, o you of little faith? then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm
the men marveled, saying, what kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
when he came to the other side, into the country of the gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way
behold, they cried out, saying, what do we have to do with you, jesus, son of god? have you come here to torment us before the time?
now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them
the demons begged him, saying, if you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs
he said to them, go! they came out, and went into the herd of pigs
and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water
those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons
behold, all the city came out to meet jesus
when they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders
he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city
behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed
jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, son, cheer up! your sins are forgiven you
behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, this man blasphemes
jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, why do you think evil in your hearts?
for which is easier, to say, your sins are forgiven; or to say, get up, and walk?
but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins


, get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house
he arose and departed to his house
but when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified god, who had given such authority to men
as jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called matthew sitting at the tax collection office
he said to him, follow me
he got up and followed him
it happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with jesus and his disciples
when the pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
when jesus heard it, he said to them, those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do
but you go and learn what this means
i desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for i came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance
then johns disciples came to him, saying, why do we and the pharisees fast often, but your disciples dont fast?
jesus said to them, can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast
no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made
neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined
no, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved
while he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, my daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live
jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples
behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;
for she said within herself, if i just touch his garment, i will be made well
but jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, daughter, cheer up! your faith has made you well
and the woman was made well from that hour
when jesus came into the rulers house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
he said to them, make room, because the girl isnt dead, but sleeping
they were ridiculing him
but when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose
the report of this went out into all that land
as jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, have mercy on us, son of david!
when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him
jesus said to them, do you believe that i am able to do this? they told him, yes, lord
then he touched their eyes, saying, according to your faith be it done to you
their eyes were opened
jesus strictly commanded them, saying, see that no one knows about this
but they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land
as they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him
when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke
the multitudes marveled, saying, nothing like this has ever been seen in israel!
but the pharisees said, by the prince of the demons, he casts out demons
jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people
but when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd
then he said to his disciples, the harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few
pray therefore that the lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest
he called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness
now the names of the twelve apostles are these
the first, simon, who is called peter; andrew, his brother; james the son of zebedee; john, his brother;
philip; bartholomew; thomas; matthew the tax collector; james the son of alphaeus; lebbaeus, whose surname was thaddaeus;
simon the canaanite; and judas iscariot, who also betrayed him
jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, dont go among the gentiles, and dont enter into any city of the samaritans
rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of israel
as you go, preach, saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand!
heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons
freely you received, so freely give
dont take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts
take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff
for the laborer is worthy of his food
into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on
as you enter into the household, greet it
if the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isnt worthy, let your peace return to you
whoever doesnt receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet
most certainly i tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city
behold, i send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves
therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves
but beware of men
for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you
yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations
but when they deliver you up, dont be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say
for it is not you who speak, but the spirit of your father who speaks in you
brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child
children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death
you will be hated by all men for my names sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved
but when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly i tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of israel, until the son of man has come
a disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord
it is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord
if they have called the master of the house beelzebul, how much more those of his household!
therefore dont be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known
what i tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops
dont be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul
rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in gehenna
arent two sparrows sold for an assarion coin ? not one of them falls on the ground apart from your fathers will,
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered
therefore dont be afraid
you are of more value than many sparrows
everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him i will also confess before my father who is in heaven
but whoever denies me before men, him i will also deny before my father who is in heaven
dont think that i came to send peace on the earth
i didnt come to send peace, but a sword
for i came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law
a mans foes will be those of his own household
he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isnt worthy of me
he who doesnt take his cross and follow after me, isnt worthy of me
he who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it
he who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me
he who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward
he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous mans reward
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly i tell you he will in no way lose his reward
it happened that when jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities
now when john heard in the prison the works of christ, he sent two of his disciples
and said to him, are you he who comes, or should we look for another?
jesus answered them, go and tell john the things which you hear and see
the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them
blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me
as these went their way, jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning john, what did you go out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind?
but what did you go out to see? a man in soft clothing? behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses
but why did you go out? to see a prophet? yes, i tell you, and much more than a prophet
for this is he, of whom it is written, behold, i send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you
most certainly i tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than john the baptizer; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
from the days of john the baptizer until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
if you are willing to receive it, this is elijah, who is to come
he who has ears to hear, let him hear
but to what shall i compare this generation? it is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions
and say, we played the flute for you, and you didnt dance
we mourned for you, and you didnt lament
for john came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, he has a demon
the son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! but wisdom is justified by her children
then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didnt repent
woe to you, chorazin! woe to you, bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
but i tell you, it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon on the day of judgment than for you
you, capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to hades
for if the mighty works had been done in sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day
but i tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you
at that time, jesus answered, i thank you, father, lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants
yes, father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight
all things have been delivered to me by my father
no one knows the son, except the father; neither does anyone know the father, except the son, and he to whom the son desires to reveal him
come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and i will give you rest
take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for i am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls
for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light
at that time, jesus went on the sabbath day through the grain fields
his disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat
but the pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the sabbath
but he said to them, havent you read what david did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;
how he entered into gods house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
or have you not read in the law, that on the sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?
but i tell you that one greater than the temple is here
but if you had known what this means, i desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless
for the son of man is lord of the sabbath
he departed there, and went into their synagogue
and behold there was a man with a withered hand
they asked him, is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him
he said to them, what man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the sabbath day, wont he grab on to it, and lift it out?
of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! therefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day
then he told the man, stretch out your hand
he stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other
but the pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him
jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there
great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,
and commanded them that they should not make him known
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet, saying,
behold, my servant whom i have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased
i will put my spirit on him
he will proclaim justice to the nations
he will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets
he wont break a bruised reed
he wont quench a smoking flax, until he leads justice to victory
in his name, the nations will hope
then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw
all the multitudes were amazed, and said, can this be the son of david?
but when the pharisees heard it, they said, this man does not cast out demons, except by beelzebul, the prince of the demons
knowing their thoughts, jesus said to them, every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand
if satan casts out satan, he is divided against himself
how then will his kingdom stand?
if i by beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they will be your judges
but if i by the spirit of god cast out demons, then the kingdom of god has come upon you
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? then he will plunder his house
he who is not with me is against me, and he who doesnt gather with me, scatters
therefore i tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven men
whoever speaks a word against the son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come
either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit
you offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks
the good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things
i tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment
for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned
then certain of the scribes and pharisees answered, teacher, we want to see a sign from you
but he answered them, an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of jonah the prophet
for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
the men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of jonah; and behold, someone greater than jonah is here
the queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon; and behold, someone greater than solomon is here
but the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesnt find it
then he says, i will return into my house from which i came out, and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order
then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there
the last state of that man becomes worse than the first
even so will it be also to this evil generation
while he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him
one said to him, behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you
but he answered him who spoke to him, who is my mother? who are my brothers?
he stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said, behold, my mother and my brothers!
for whoever does the will of my father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother
on that day jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside
great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach
he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, behold, a farmer went out to sow
as he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them
others fell on rocky ground, where they didnt have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth
when the sun had risen, they were scorched
because they had no root, they withered away
others fell among thorns
the thorns grew up and choked them
others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit
some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty
he who has ears to hear, let him hear
the disciples came, and said to him, why do you speak to them in parables?
he answered them, to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but it is not given to them
for whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesnt have, from him will be taken away even that which he has
therefore i speak to them in parables, because seeing they dont see, and hearing, they dont hear, neither do they understand
in them the prophecy of isaiah is fulfilled, which says, by hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive
for this peoples heart has grown callous, their ears are dull of hearing, they have closed their eyes; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and should turn again; and i would heal them
but blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear
for most certainly i tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didnt see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didnt hear them
hear, then, the parable of the farmer
when anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and doesnt understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart
this is what was sown by the roadside
what was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while
when oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles
what was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful
what was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty
he set another parable before them, saying, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,
but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away
but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also
the servants of the householder came and said to him, sir, didnt you sow good seed in your field? where did this darnel come from?
he said to them, an enemy has done this
the servants asked him, do you want us to go and gather them up?
but he said, no, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them
let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time i will tell the reapers, first, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn
he set another parable before them, saying, the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;
which indeed is smaller than all seeds
but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches
he spoke another parable to them
the kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened
jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didnt speak to them,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, i will open my mouth in parables; i will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world
then jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house
his disciples came to him, saying, explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field
he answered them, he who sows the good seed is the son of man,
the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one
the enemy who sowed them is the devil
the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels
as therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age
the son of man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,
and will cast them into the furnace of fire
there will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their father
he who has ears to hear, let him hear
again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid
in his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field
again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,
who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it
again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,
which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach
they sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away
so will it be in the end of the world
the angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
and will cast them into the furnace of fire
there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth
jesus said to them, have you understood all these things? they answered him, yes, lord
he said to them, therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things
it happened that when jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there
coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?
isnt this the carpenters son? isnt his mother called mary, and his brothers, james, joses, simon, and judas ?
arent all of his sisters with us? where then did this man get all of these things?
they were offended by him
but jesus said to them, a prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house
he didnt do many mighty works there because of their unbelief
at that time, herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning jesus,
and said to his servants, this is john the baptizer
he is risen from the dead
that is why these powers work in him
for herod had laid hold of john, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of herodias, his brother philips wife
for john said to him, it is not lawful for you to have her
when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet
but when herods birthday came, the daughter of herodias danced among them and pleased herod
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask
she, being prompted by her mother, said, give me here on a platter the head of john the baptizer
the king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,
and he sent and beheaded john in the prison
his head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady
and she brought it to her mother
his disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told jesus
now when jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart
when the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities
jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude
he had compassion on them, and healed their sick
when evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, this place is deserted, and the hour is already late
send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food
but jesus said to them, they dont need to go away
you give them something to eat
they told him, we only have here five loaves and two fish
he said, bring them here to me
he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes
they all ate, and were filled
they took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces
those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children
immediately jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away
after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray
when evening had come, he was there alone
but the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary
in the fourth watch of the night, jesus came to them, walking on the sea
when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, its a ghost! and they cried out for fear
but immediately jesus spoke to them, saying cheer up! it is i! dont be afraid
peter answered him and said, lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters
he said, come! peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to jesus
but when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, lord, save me!
immediately jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, you of little faith, why did you doubt?
when they got up into the boat, the wind ceased
those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, you are truly the son of god!
when they had crossed over, they came to the land of gennesaret
when the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,
and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment
as many as touched it were made whole
then pharisees and scribes came to jesus from jerusalem, saying,
why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? for they dont wash their hands when they eat bread
he answered them, why do you also disobey the commandment of god because of your tradition?
for god commanded, honor your father and your mother, and, he who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death
but you say, whoever may tell his father or his mother, whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to god,
he shall not honor his father or mother
you have made the commandment of god void because of your tradition
you hypocrites! well did isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
these people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me
and in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men
he summoned the multitude, and said to them, hear, and understand
that which enters into the mouth doesnt defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man
then the disciples came, and said to him, do you know that the pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?
but he answered, every plant which my heavenly father didnt plant will be uprooted
leave them alone
they are blind guides of the blind
if the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit
peter answered him, explain the parable to us
so jesus said, do you also still not understand?
dont you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
but the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man
for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies
these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesnt defile the man
jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of tyre and sidon
behold, a canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, have mercy on me, lord, you son of david! my daughter is severely demonized!
but he answered her not a word
his disciples came and begged him, saying, send her away; for she cries after us
but he answered, i wasnt sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of israel
but she came and worshiped him, saying, lord, help me
but he answered, it is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
but she said, yes, lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters table
then jesus answered her, woman, great is your faith! be it done to you even as you desire
and her daughter was healed from that hour
jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there
great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet
he healed them,
so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing--and they glorified the god of israel
jesus summoned his disciples and said, i have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat
i dont want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way
the disciples said to him, where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?
jesus said to them, how many loaves do you have? they said, seven, and a few small fish
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
and he took the seven loaves and the fish
he gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes
they all ate, and were filled
they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over
those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children
then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of magdala
the pharisees and sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven
but he answered them, when it is evening, you say, it will be fair weather, for the sky is red
in the morning, it will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening
hypocrites! you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you cant discern the signs of the times!
an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet jonah
he left them, and departed
the disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread
jesus said to them, take heed and beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
they reasoned among themselves, saying, we brought no bread
jesus, perceiving it, said, why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread?
dont you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
how is it that you dont perceive that i didnt speak to you concerning bread? but beware of the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees
then they understood that he didnt tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees
now when jesus came into the parts of caesarea philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, who do men say that i, the son of man, am?
they said, some say john the baptizer, some, elijah, and others, jeremiah, or one of the prophets
he said to them, but who do you say that i am?
simon peter answered, you are the christ, the son of the living god
jesus answered him, blessed are you, simon bar jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father who is in heaven
i also tell you that you are peter, and on this rock i will build my assembly, and the gates of hades will not prevail against it
i will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven
then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was jesus the christ
from that time, jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up
peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, far be it from you, lord! this will never be done to you
but he turned, and said to peter, get behind me, satan! you are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of god, but on the things of men
then jesus said to his disciples, if anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it
for what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? or what will a man give in exchange for his life?
for the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds
most certainly i tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
after six days, jesus took with him peter, james, and john his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves
he was transfigured before them
his face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light
behold, moses and elijah appeared to them talking with him
peter answered, and said to jesus, lord, it is good for us to be here
if you want, lets make three tents here
one for you, one for moses, and one for elijah
while he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them
behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased
listen to him
when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid
jesus came and touched them and said, get up, and dont be afraid
lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except jesus alone
as they were coming down from the mountain, jesus commanded them, saying, dont tell anyone what you saw, until the son of man has risen from the dead
his disciples asked him, saying, then why do the scribes say that elijah must come first?
jesus answered them, elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
but i tell you that elijah has come already, and they didnt recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to
even so the son of man will also suffer by them
then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of john the baptizer
when they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,
lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water
so i brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him
jesus answered, faithless and perverse generation! how long will i be with you? how long will i bear with you? bring him here to me
jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour
then the disciples came to jesus privately, and said, why werent we able to cast it out?
he said to them, because of your unbelief
for most certainly i tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you
but this kind doesnt go out except by prayer and fasting
while they were staying in galilee, jesus said to them, the son of man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,
and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up
they were exceedingly sorry
when they had come to capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to peter, and said, doesnt your teacher pay the didrachma?
he said, yes
when he came into the house, jesus anticipated him, saying, what do you think, simon? from whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? from their children, or from strangers?
peter said to him, from strangers
jesus said to him, therefore the children are exempt
but, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up
when you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin
take that, and give it to them for me and you
in that hour the disciples came to jesus, saying, who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in their midst,
and said, most certainly i tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the kingdom of heaven
whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea
woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!
if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you
it is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire
if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you
it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the gehenna of fire
see that you dont despise one of these little ones, for i tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my father who is in heaven
for the son of man came to save that which was lost
what do you think? if a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesnt he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
if he finds it, most certainly i tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray
even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
if your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone
if he listens to you, you have gained back your brother
but if he doesnt listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly
if he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a gentile or a tax collector
most certainly i tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven
again, assuredly i tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my father who is in heaven
for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there i am in their midst
then peter came and said to him, lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and i forgive him? until seven times?
jesus said to him, i dont tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven
therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants
when he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents
but because he couldnt pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made
the servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, lord, have patience with me, and i will repay you all!
the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt
but that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, pay me what you owe!
so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, have patience with me, and i will repay you!
he would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due
so when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done
then his lord called him in, and said to him, you wicked servant! i forgave you all that debt, because you begged me
shouldnt you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as i had mercy on you?
his lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him
so my heavenly father will also do to you, if you dont each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds
it happened when jesus had finished these words, he departed from galilee, and came into the borders of judea beyond the jordan
great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there
pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?
he answered, havent you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,
and said, for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?
so that they are no more two, but one flesh
what therefore god has joined together, dont let man tear apart
they asked him, why then did moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?
he said to them, moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so
i tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery
his disciples said to him, if this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry
but he said to them, not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given
for there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake
he who is able to receive it, let him receive it
then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them
but jesus said, allow the little children, and dont forbid them to come to me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to ones like these
he laid his hands on them, and departed from there
behold, one came to him and said, good teacher, what good thing shall i do, that i may have eternal life?
he said to him, why do you call me good? no one is good but one, that is, god
but if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments
he said to him, which ones? jesus said, you shall not murder
you shall not commit adultery
you shall not steal
you shall not offer false testimony
honor your father and mother
and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself
the young man said to him, all these things i have observed from my youth
what do i still lack?
jesus said to him, if you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me
but when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions
jesus said to his disciples, most certainly i say to you, a rich man will enter into the kingdom of heaven with difficulty
again i tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
when the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, who then can be saved?
looking at them, jesus said, with men this is impossible, but with god all things are possible
then peter answered, behold, we have left everything, and followed you
what then will we have?
jesus said to them, most certainly i tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the son of man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of israel
everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life
but many will be last who are first; and first who are last
for the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard
when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard
he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
to them he said, you also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right i will give you
so they went their way
again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise
about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle
he said to them, why do you stand here all day idle?
they said to him, because no one has hired us
he said to them, you also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right
when evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first
when those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius
when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius
when they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,
saying, these last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!
but he answered one of them, friend, i am doing you no wrong
didnt you agree with me for a denarius?
take that which is yours, and go your way
it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you
isnt it lawful for me to do what i want to with what i own? or is your eye evil, because i am good?
so the last will be first, and the first last
for many are called, but few are chosen
as jesus was going up to jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
behold, we are going up to jerusalem, and the son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
and will hand him over to the gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up
then the mother of the sons of zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him
he said to her, what do you want? she said to him, command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your kingdom
but jesus answered, you dont know what you are asking
are you able to drink the cup that i am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with? they said to him, we are able
he said to them, you will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my father
when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers
but jesus summoned them, and said, you know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them
it shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant
whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,
even as the son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many
as they went out from jericho, a great multitude followed him
behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that jesus was passing by, cried out, lord, have mercy on us, you son of david!
the multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, lord, have mercy on us, you son of david!
jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, what do you want me to do for you?
they told him, lord, that our eyes may be opened
jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him
when they drew near to jerusalem, and came to bethsphage, to the mount of olives, then jesus sent two disciples,
saying to them, go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her
untie them, and bring them to me
if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, the lord needs them, and immediately he will send them
all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
tell the daughter of zion, behold, your king comes to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey
the disciples went, and did just as jesus commanded them,
and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them
a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road
others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road
the multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, hosanna to the son of david! blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord! hosanna in the highest!
when he had come into jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, who is this?
the multitudes said, this is the prophet, jesus, from nazareth of galilee
jesus entered into the temple of god, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers tables and the seats of those who sold the doves
he said to them, it is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers!
the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them
but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, hosanna to the son of david! they were indignant,
and said to him, do you hear what these are saying? jesus said to them, yes
did you never read, out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?
he left them, and went out of the city to bethany, and lodged there
now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry
seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves
he said to it, let there be no fruit from you forever! immediately the fig tree withered away
when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, how did the fig tree immediately wither away?
jesus answered them, most certainly i tell you, if you have faith, and dont doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, be taken up and cast into the sea, it would be done
all things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive
when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, by what authority do you do these things? who gave you this authority?
jesus answered them, i also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, i likewise will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john, where was it from? from heaven or from men? they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we say, from heaven, he will ask us, why then did you not believe him?
but if we say, from men, we fear the multitude, for all hold john as a prophet
they answered jesus, and said, we dont know
he also said to them, neither will i tell you by what authority i do these things
but what do you think? a man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, son, go work today in my vineyard
he answered, i will not, but afterward he changed his mind, and went
he came to the second, and said the same thing
he answered, i go, sir, but he didnt go
which of the two did the will of his father? they said to him, the first
jesus said to them, most certainly i tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the kingdom of god before you
for john came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didnt believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him
when you saw it, you didnt even repent afterward, that you might believe him
hear another parable
there was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country
when the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit
the farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another
again, he sent other servants more than the first
and they treated them the same way
but afterward he sent to them his son, saying, they will respect my son
but the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, this is the heir
come, lets kill him, and seize his inheritance
so they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him
when therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?
they told him, he will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season
jesus said to them, did you never read in the scriptures, the stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner
this was from the lord
it is marvelous in our eyes?
therefore i tell you, the kingdom of god will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit
he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust
when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them
when they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet
jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come
again he sent out other servants, saying, tell those who are invited, behold, i have prepared my dinner
my cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready
come to the marriage feast!
but they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,
and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them
when the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city
then he said to his servants, the wedding is ready, but those who were invited werent worthy
go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast
those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good
the wedding was filled with guests
but when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didnt have on wedding clothing,
and he said to him, friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing? he was speechless
then the king said to the servants, bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be
for many are called, but few chosen
then the pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk
they sent their disciples to him, along with the herodians, saying, teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of god in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you arent partial to anyone
tell us therefore, what do you think? is it lawful to pay taxes to caesar, or not?
but jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, why do you test me, you hypocrites?
show me the tax money
they brought to him a denarius
he asked them, whose is this image and inscription?
they said to him, caesars
then he said to them, give therefore to caesar the things that are caesars, and to god the things that are gods
when they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away
on that day sadducees  came to him
they asked him,
saying, teacher, moses said, if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother
now there were with us seven brothers
the first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother
in the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh
after them all, the woman died
in the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? for they all had her
but jesus answered them, you are mistaken, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of god
for in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like gods angels in heaven
but concerning the resurrection of the dead, havent you read that which was spoken to you by god, saying,
i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob? god is not the god of the dead, but of the living
when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching
but the pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the sadducees, gathered themselves together
one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him
teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
jesus said to him, you shall love the lord your god with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind
this is the first and great commandment
a second likewise is this, you shall love your neighbor as yourself
the whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments
now while the pharisees were gathered together, jesus asked them a question,
saying, what do you think of the christ? whose son is he? they said to him, of david
he said to them, how then does david in the spirit call him lord, saying,
the lord said to my lord, sit on my right hand, until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet?
if then david calls him lord, how is he his son?
no one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth
then jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
saying, the scribes and the pharisees sat on moses seat
all things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but dont do their works; for they say, and dont do
for they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on mens shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them
but all their works they do to be seen by men
they make their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringes of their garments,
and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,
the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called rabbi, rabbi by men
but dont you be called rabbi, for one is your teacher, the christ, and all of you are brothers
call no man on the earth your father, for one is your father, he who is in heaven
neither be called masters, for one is your master, the christ
but he who is greatest among you will be your servant
whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers
therefore you will receive greater condemnation
but woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! because you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you dont enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter
woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of gehenna as yourselves
woe to you, you blind guides, who say, whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated
you blind fools! for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?
you blind fools! for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
he therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it
he who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who was living in it
he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of god, and by him who sits on it
woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law
justice, mercy, and faith
but you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone
you blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness
you blind pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also
woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanness
even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,
and say, if we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldnt have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets
therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets
fill up, then, the measure of your fathers
you serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of gehenna ?
therefore behold, i send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes
some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zachariah son of barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar
most certainly i tell you, all these things will come upon this generation
jerusalem, jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! how often i would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!
behold, your house is left to you desolate
for i tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord!
jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way
his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple
but he answered them, you see all of these things, dont you? most certainly i tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down
as he sat on the mount of olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, tell us, when will these things be? what is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?
jesus answered them, be careful that no one leads you astray
for many will come in my name, saying, i am the christ, and will lead many astray
you will hear of wars and rumors of wars
see that you arent troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet
for nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places
but all these things are the beginning of birth pains
then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you
you will be hated by all of the nations for my names sake
then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another
many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray
because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold
but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved
this good news of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come
when, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place,
then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains
let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house
let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes
but woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!
pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a sabbath,
for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be
unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved
but for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened
then if any man tells you, behold, here is the christ, or, there, dont believe it
for there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones
behold, i have told you beforehand
if therefore they tell you, behold, he is in the wilderness, dont go out; behold, he is in the inner rooms, dont believe it
for as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the son of man
for wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together
but immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;
and then the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky
then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory
he will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other
now from the fig tree learn this parable
when its branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near
even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors
most certainly i tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished
heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away
but no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my father only
as the days of noah were, so will be the coming of the son of man
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that noah entered into the ship,
and they didnt know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the son of man
then two men will be in the field
one will be taken and one will be left;
two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left
watch therefore, for you dont know in what hour your lord comes
but know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into
therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you dont expect, the son of man will come
who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes
most certainly i tell you that he will set him over all that he has
but if that evil servant should say in his heart, my lord is delaying his coming,
and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesnt expect it, and in an hour when he doesnt know it,
and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites
there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be
then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom
five of them were foolish, and five were wise
those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept
but at midnight there was a cry, behold! the bridegroom is coming! come out to meet him!
then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps
the foolish said to the wise, give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out
but the wise answered, saying, what if there isnt enough for us and you? you go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves
while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut
afterward the other virgins also came, saying, lord, lord, open to us
but he answered, most certainly i tell you, i dont know you
watch therefore, for you dont know the day nor the hour in which the son of man is coming
for it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them
to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability
then he went on his journey
immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents
in the same way, he also who got the two gained another two
but he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lords money
now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them
he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, lord, you delivered to me five talents
behold, i have gained another five talents besides them
his lord said to him, well done, good and faithful servant
you have been faithful over a few things, i will set you over many things
enter into the joy of your lord
he also who got the two talents came and said, lord, you delivered to me two talents
behold, i have gained another two talents besides them
his lord said to him, well done, good and faithful servant
you have been faithful over a few things, i will set you over many things
enter into the joy of your lord
he also who had received the one talent came and said, lord, i knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter
i was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth
behold, you have what is yours
but his lord answered him, you wicked and slothful servant
you knew that i reap where i didnt sow, and gather where i didnt scatter
you ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming i should have received back my own with interest
take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents
for to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesnt have, even that which he has will be taken away
throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
but when the son of man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory
before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left
then the king will tell those on his right hand, come, blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
for i was hungry, and you gave me food to eat
i was thirsty, and you gave me drink
i was a stranger, and you took me in
i was naked, and you clothed me
i was sick, and you visited me
i was in prison, and you came to me
then the righteous will answer him, saying, lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
when did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?
when did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?
the king will answer them, most certainly i tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me
then he will say also to those on the left hand, depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;
for i was hungry, and you didnt give me food to eat; i was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
i was a stranger, and you didnt take me in; naked, and you didnt clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didnt visit me
then they will also answer, saying, lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didnt help you?
then he will answer them, saying, most certainly i tell you, inasmuch as you didnt do it to one of the least of these, you didnt do it to me
these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life
it happened, when jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,
you know that after two days the passover is coming, and the son of man will be delivered up to be crucified
then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called caiaphas
they took counsel together that they might take jesus by deceit, and kill him
but they said, not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people
now when jesus was in bethany, in the house of simon the leper,
a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table
but when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, why this waste?
for this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor
however, knowing this, jesus said to them, why do you trouble the woman? because she has done a good work for me
for you always have the poor with you; but you dont always have me
for in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial
most certainly i tell you, wherever this good news is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her
then one of the twelve, who was called judas iscariot, went to the chief priests,
and said, what are you willing to give me, that i should deliver him to you? they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver
from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to jesus, saying to him, where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the passover?
he said, go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, the teacher says, my time is at hand
i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples
the disciples did as jesus commanded them, and they prepared the passover
now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples
as they were eating, he said, most certainly i tell you that one of you will betray me
they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, it isnt me, is it, lord?
he answered, he who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me
the son of man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the son of man is betrayed! it would be better for that man if he had not been born
judas, who betrayed him, answered, it isnt me, is it, rabbi? he said to him, you said it
as they were eating, jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it
he gave to the disciples, and said, take, eat; this is my body
he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, all of you drink it,
for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins
but i tell you that i will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when i drink it anew with you in my fathers kingdom
when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of olives
then jesus said to them, all of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, i will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
but after i am raised up, i will go before you into galilee
but peter answered him, even if all will be made to stumble because of you, i will never be made to stumble
jesus said to him, most certainly i tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times
peter said to him, even if i must die with you, i will not deny you
all of the disciples also said likewise
then jesus came with them to a place called gethsemane, and said to his disciples, sit here, while i go there and pray
he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled
then he said to them, my soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death
stay here, and watch with me
he went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, my father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what i desire, but what you desire
he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to peter, what, couldnt you watch with me for one hour?
watch and pray, that you dont enter into temptation
the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak
again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, my father, if this cup cant pass away from me unless i drink it, your desire be done
he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy
he left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words
then he came to his disciples, and said to them, sleep on now, and take your rest
behold, the hour is at hand, and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
arise, lets be going
behold, he who betrays me is at hand
while he was still speaking, behold, judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people
now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, whoever i kiss, he is the one
seize him
immediately he came to jesus, and said, hail, rabbi! and kissed him
jesus said to him, friend, why are you here? then they came and laid hands on jesus, and took him
behold, one of those who were with jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear
then jesus said to him, put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword
or do you think that i couldnt ask my father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?
in that hour jesus said to the multitudes, have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? i sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didnt arrest me
but all this has happened, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled
then all the disciples left him, and fled
those who had taken jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together
but peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end
now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against jesus, that they might put him to death;
and they found none
even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none
but at last two false witnesses came forward,
and said, this man said, i am able to destroy the temple of god, and to build it in three days
the high priest stood up, and said to him, have you no answer? what is this that these testify against you?
but jesus held his peace
the high priest answered him, i adjure you by the living god, that you tell us whether you are the christ, the son of god
jesus said to him, you have said it
nevertheless, i tell you, after this you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of the sky
then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, he has spoken blasphemy! why do we need any more witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy
what do you think? they answered, he is worthy of death!
then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,
saying, prophesy to us, you christ! who hit you?
now peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, you were also with jesus, the galilean!
but he denied it before them all, saying, i dont know what you are talking about
when he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, this man also was with jesus of nazareth
again he denied it with an oath, i dont know the man
after a little while those who stood by came and said to peter, surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known
then he began to curse and to swear, i dont know the man! immediately the rooster crowed
peter remembered the word which jesus had said to him, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times
he went out and wept bitterly
now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death
and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to pontius pilate, the governor
then judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
saying, i have sinned in that i betrayed innocent blood
but they said, what is that to us? you see to it
he threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed
he went away and hanged himself
the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, its not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood
they took counsel, and bought the potters field with them, to bury strangers in
therefore that field was called the field of blood to this day
then that which was spoken through jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him upon whom a price had been set, whom some of the children of israel priced,
and they gave them for the potters field, as the lord commanded me
now jesus stood before the governor
and the governor asked him, saying, are you the king of the jews? jesus said to him, so you say
when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing
then pilate said to him, dont you hear how many things they testify against you?
he gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly
now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired
they had then a notable prisoner, called barabbas
when therefore they were gathered together, pilate said to them, whom do you want me to release to you? barabbas, or jesus, who is called christ?
for he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up
while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, have nothing to do with that righteous man, for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him
now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for barabbas, and destroy jesus
but the governor answered them, which of the two do you want me to release to you? they said, barabbas!
pilate said to them, what then shall i do to jesus, who is called christ? they all said to him, let him be crucified!
but the governor said, why? what evil has he done? but they cried out exceedingly, saying, let him be crucified!
so when pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, i am innocent of the blood of this righteous person
you see to it
all the people answered, may his blood be on us, and on our children!
then he released to them barabbas, but jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified
then the governors soldiers took jesus into the praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him
they stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him
they braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, hail, king of the jews!
they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head
when they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him
as they came out, they found a man of cyrene, simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross
they came to a place called golgotha, that is to say, the place of a skull
they gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall
when he had tasted it, he would not drink
when they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,
and they sat and watched him there
they set up over his head the accusation against him written, this is jesus, the king of the jews
then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left
those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
and saying, you who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! if you are the son of god, come down from the cross!
likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the pharisees, and the elders, said,
he saved others, but he cant save himself
if he is the king of israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him
he trusts in god
let god deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, i am the son of god
the robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour
about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, eli, eli, lima sabachthani? that is, my god, my god, why have you forsaken me?
some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, this man is calling elijah
immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink
the rest said, let him be
lets see whether elijah comes to save him
jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit
behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom
the earth quaked and the rocks were split
the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many
now the centurion, and those who were with him watching jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, truly this was the son of god
many women were there watching from afar, who had followed jesus from galilee, serving him
among them were mary magdalene, mary the mother of james and joses, and the mother of the sons of zebedee
when evening had come, a rich man from arimathaea, named joseph, who himself was also jesus disciple came
this man went to pilate, and asked for jesus body
then pilate commanded the body to be given up
joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed
mary magdalene was there, and the other mary, sitting opposite the tomb
now on the next day, which was the day after the preparation day, the chief priests and the pharisees were gathered together to pilate,
saying, sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive
after three days i will rise again
command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, he is risen from the dead; and the last deception will be worse than the first
pilate said to them, you have a guard
go, make it as secure as you can
so they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone
now after the sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, mary magdalene and the other mary came to see the tomb
behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it
his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow
for fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men
the angel answered the women, dont be afraid, for i know that you seek jesus, who has been crucified
he is not here, for he has risen, just like he said
come, see the place where the lord was lying
go quickly and tell his disciples, he has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into galilee; there you will see him
behold, i have told you
they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word
as they went to tell his disciples, behold, jesus met them, saying, rejoice! they came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him
then jesus said to them, dont be afraid
go tell my brothers that they should go into galilee, and there they will see me
now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened
when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
saying, say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept
if this comes to the governors ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry
so they took the money and did as they were told
this saying was spread abroad among the jews, and continues until this day
but the eleven disciples went into galilee, to the mountain where jesus had sent them
when they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted
jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit,
teaching them to observe all things that i commanded you
behold, i am with you always, even to the end of the age
amen
the beginning of the good news of jesus christ, the son of god
as it is written in the prophets, behold, i send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you
the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the lord! make his paths straight!
john came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins
all the country of judea and all those of jerusalem went out to him
they were baptized by him in the jordan river, confessing their sins
john was clothed with camels hair and a leather belt around his waist
he ate locusts and wild honey
he preached, saying, after me comes he who is mightier than i, the thong of whose sandals i am not worthy to stoop down and loosen
i baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the holy spirit
it happened in those days, that jesus came from nazareth of galilee, and was baptized by john in the jordan
immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the spirit descending on him like a dove
a voice came out of the sky, you are my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased
immediately the spirit drove him out into the wilderness
he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by satan
he was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him
now after john was taken into custody, jesus came into galilee, preaching the good news of the kingdom of god,
and saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of god is at hand! repent, and believe in the good news
passing along by the sea of galilee, he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen
jesus said to them, come after me, and i will make you into fishers for men
immediately they left their nets, and followed him
going on a little further from there, he saw james the son of zebedee, and john, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets
immediately he called them, and they left their father, zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him
they went into capernaum, and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught
they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes
immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
saying, ha! what do we have to do with you, jesus, you nazarene? have you come to destroy us? i know you who you are
the holy one of god!
jesus rebuked him, saying, be quiet, and come out of him!
the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him
they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, what is this? a new teaching? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!
the report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of galilee and its surrounding area
immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of simon and andrew, with james and john
now simons wifes mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her
he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up
the fever left her, and she served them
at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons
all the city was gathered together at the door
he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons
he didnt allow the demons to speak, because they knew him
early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there
simon and those who were with him followed after him;
and they found him, and told him, everyone is looking for you
he said to them, lets go elsewhere into the next towns, that i may preach there also, because i came out for this reason
he went into their synagogues throughout all galilee, preaching and casting out demons
a leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, if you want to, you can make me clean
being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, i want to
be made clean
when he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean
he strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,
and said to him, see you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which moses commanded, for a testimony to them
but he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places
and they came to him from everywhere
when he entered again into capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house
immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them
four people came, carrying a paralytic to him
when they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was
when they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on
jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, son, your sins are forgiven you
but there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
why does this man speak blasphemies like that? who can forgive sins but god alone?
immediately jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, why do you reason these things in your hearts?
which is easier, to tell the paralytic, your sins are forgiven; or to say, arise, and take up your bed, and walk?
but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he said to the paralytic--
i tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house
he arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified god, saying, we never saw anything like this!
he went out again by the seaside
all the multitude came to him, and he taught them
as he passed by, he saw levi, the son of alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, follow me
and he arose and followed him
it happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him
the scribes and the pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?
when jesus heard it, he said to them, those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick
i came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance
johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees fast, but your disciples dont fast?
jesus said to them, can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cant fast
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day
no one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made
no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins
it happened that he was going on the sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain
the pharisees said to him, behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the sabbath day?
he said to them, did you never read what david did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him?
how he entered into gods house when abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?
he said to them, the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath
therefore the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered
they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day, that they might accuse him
he said to the man who had his hand withered, stand up
he said to them, is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? but they were silent
when he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, stretch out your hand
he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other
the pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the herodians against him, how they might destroy him
jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from galilee, from judea,
from jerusalem, from idumaea, beyond the jordan, and those from around tyre and sidon
a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him
he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldnt press on him
for he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him
the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, you are the son of god!
he sternly warned them that they should not make him known
he went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him
he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons
simon, to whom he gave the name peter;
james the son of zebedee; john, the brother of james, and he surnamed them boanerges, which means, sons of thunder;
andrew; philip; bartholomew; matthew; thomas; james, the son of alphaeus; thaddaeus; simon the zealot;
and judas iscariot, who also betrayed him
he came into a house
the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread
when his friends heard it, they went out to seize him
for they said, he is insane
the scribes who came down from jerusalem said, he has beelzebul, and, by the prince of the demons he casts out the demons
he summoned them, and said to them in parables, how can satan cast out satan?
if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand
if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand
if satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cant stand, but has an end
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house
most certainly i tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;
but whoever may blaspheme against the holy spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin
--because they said, he has an unclean spirit
his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him
a multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you
he answered them, who are my mother and my brothers?
looking around at those who sat around him, he said, behold, my mother and my brothers!
for whoever does the will of god, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother
again he began to teach by the seaside
a great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down
all the multitude were on the land by the sea
he taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,
listen! behold, the farmer went out to sow,
and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it
others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil
when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away
others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit
others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing
some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much
he said, whoever has ears to hear, let him hear
when he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables
he said to them, to you is given the mystery of the kingdom of god, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,
that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them
he said to them, dont you understand this parable? how will you understand all of the parables?
the farmer sows the word
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them
these in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy
they have no root in themselves, but are short-lived
when oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble
others are those who are sown among the thorns
these are those who have heard the word,
and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful
those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times
he said to them, is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? isnt it put on a stand?
for there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light
if any man has ears to hear, let him hear
he said to them, take heed what you hear
with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear
for whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesnt have, even that which he has will be taken away from him
he said, the kingdom of god is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,
and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesnt know how
for the earth bears fruit
first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear
but when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come
he said, how will we liken the kingdom of god? or with what parable will we illustrate it?
its like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,
yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow
with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it
without a parable he didnt speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything
on that day, when evening had come, he said to them, lets go over to the other side
leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat
other small boats were also with him
a big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled
he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, teacher, dont you care that we are dying?
he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, peace! be still! the wind ceased, and there was a great calm
he said to them, why are you so afraid? how is it that you have no faith?
they were greatly afraid, and said to one another, who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the gadarenes
when he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs
he lived in the tombs
nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces
nobody had the strength to tame him
always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones
when he saw jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,
and crying out with a loud voice, he said, what have i to do with you, jesus, you son of the most high god? i adjure you by god, dont torment me
for he said to him, come out of the man, you unclean spirit!
he asked him, what is your name? he said to him, my name is legion, for we are many
he begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country
now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding
all the demons begged him, saying, send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them
at once jesus gave them permission
the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs
the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea
those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country
the people came to see what it was that had happened
they came to jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid
those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs
they began to beg him to depart from their region
as he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him
he didnt allow him, but said to him, go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you
he went his way, and began to proclaim in decapolis how jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled
when jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea
behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
and begged him much, saying, my little daughter is at the point of death
please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live
he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides
a certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,
having heard the things concerning jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes
for she said, if i just touch his clothes, i will be made well
immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction
immediately jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, who touched my clothes?
his disciples said to him, you see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, who touched me?
he looked around to see her who had done this thing
but the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth
he said to her, daughter, your faith has made you well
go in peace, and be cured of your disease
while he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue rulers house saying, your daughter is dead
why bother the teacher any more?
but jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, dont be afraid, only believe
he allowed no one to follow him, except peter, james, and john the brother of james
he came to the synagogue rulers house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing
when he had entered in, he said to them, why do you make an uproar and weep? the child is not dead, but is asleep
they ridiculed him
but he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying
taking the child by the hand, he said to her, talitha cumi! which means, being interpreted, girl, i tell you, get up!
immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old
they were amazed with great amazement
he strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat
he went out from there
he came into his own country, and his disciples followed him
when the sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, where did this man get these things? and, what is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?
isnt this the carpenter, the son of mary, and brother of james, joses, judah, and simon? arent his sisters here with us? they were offended at him
jesus said to them, a prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house
he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them
he marveled because of their unbelief
he went around the villages teaching
he called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits
he commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only
no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,
but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics
he said to them, wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there
whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them
assuredly, i tell you, it will be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!
they went out and preached that people should repent
they cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them
king herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, john the baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him
but others said, he is elijah
others said, he is a prophet, or like one of the prophets
but herod, when he heard this, said, this is john, whom i beheaded
he has risen from the dead
for herod himself had sent out and arrested john, and bound him in prison for the sake of herodias, his brother philips wife, for he had married her
for john said to herod, it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife
herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldnt,
for herod feared john, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe
when he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly
then a convenient day came, that herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of galilee
when the daughter of herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased herod and those sitting with him
the king said to the young lady, ask me whatever you want, and i will give it to you
he swore to her, whatever you shall ask of me, i will give you, up to half of my kingdom
she went out, and said to her mother, what shall i ask? she said, the head of john the baptizer
she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, i want you to give me right now the head of john the baptizer on a platter
the king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didnt wish to refuse her
immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring johns head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother
when his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb
the apostles gathered themselves together to jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught
he said to them, you come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile
for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat
they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves
they saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities
they arrived before them and came together to him
jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things
when it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, this place is deserted, and it is late in the day
send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat
but he answered them, you give them something to eat
they asked him, shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?
he said to them, how many loaves do you have? go see
when they knew, they said, five, and two fish
he commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass
they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties
he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all
they all ate, and were filled
they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish
those who ate the loaves were five thousand men
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away
after he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray
when evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land
seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,
but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
for they all saw him, and were troubled
but he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, cheer up! it is i! dont be afraid
he got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;
for they hadnt understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened
when they had crossed over, they came to land at gennesaret, and moored to the shore
when they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,
and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was
wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well
then the pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from jerusalem
now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault
(for the pharisees, and all the jews, dont eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders
they dont eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to
washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches
)
the pharisees and the scribes asked him, why dont your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?
he answered them, well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, this people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me
but in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men
for you set aside the commandment of god, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things
he said to them, full well do you reject the commandment of god, that you may keep your tradition
for moses said, honor your father and your mother; and, he who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death
but you say, if a man tells his father or his mother, whatever profit you might have received from me is corban, that is to say, given to god;
then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,
making void the word of god by your tradition, which you have handed down
you do many things like this
he called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, hear me, all of you, and understand
there is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man
if anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!
when he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable
he said to them, are you thus without understanding also? dont you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside cant defile him,
because it doesnt go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods ?
he said, that which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man
for from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,
covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness
all these evil things come from within, and defile the man
from there he arose, and went away into the borders of tyre and sidon
he entered into a house, and didnt want anyone to know it, but he couldnt escape notice
for a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet
now the woman was a greek, a syrophoenician by race
she begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter
but jesus said to her, let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs
but she answered him, yes, lord
yet even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs
he said to her, for this saying, go your way
the demon has gone out of your daughter
she went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out
again he departed from the borders of tyre and sidon, and came to the sea of galilee, through the midst of the region of decapolis
they brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech
they begged him to lay his hand on him
he took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue
looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, ephphatha! that is, be opened!
immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly
he commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it
they were astonished beyond measure, saying, he has done all things well
he makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!
in those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,
i have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat
if i send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way
his disciples answered him, from where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?
he asked them, how many loaves do you have? they said, seven
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves
having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude
they had a few small fish
having blessed them, he said to serve these also
they ate, and were filled
they took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over
those who had eaten were about four thousand
then he sent them away
immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of dalmanutha
the pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him
he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, why does this generation seek a sign? most certainly i tell you, no sign will be given to this generation
he left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side
they forgot to take bread; and they didnt have more than one loaf in the boat with them
he warned them, saying, take heed
beware of the yeast of the pharisees and the yeast of herod
they reasoned with one another, saying, its because we have no bread
jesus, perceiving it, said to them, why do you reason that its because you have no bread? dont you perceive yet, neither understand? is your heart still hardened?
having eyes, dont you see? having ears, dont you hear? dont you remember?
when i broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? they told him, twelve
when the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? they told him, seven
he asked them, dont you understand, yet?
he came to bethsaida
they brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him
he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village
when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything
he looked up, and said, i see men; for i see them like trees walking
then again he laid his hands on his eyes
he looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly
he sent him away to his house, saying, dont enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the village
jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of caesarea philippi
on the way he asked his disciples, who do men say that i am?
they told him, john the baptizer, and others say elijah, but others
one of the prophets
he said to them, but who do you say that i am? peter answered, you are the christ
he commanded them that they should tell no one about him
he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again
he spoke to them openly
peter took him, and began to rebuke him
but he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked peter, and said, get behind me, satan! for you have in mind not the things of god, but the things of men
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the good news will save it
for what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
for what will a man give in exchange for his life?
for whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
he said to them, most certainly i tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the kingdom of god come with power
after six days jesus took with him peter, james, and john, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them
his clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them
elijah and moses appeared to them, and they were talking with jesus
peter answered jesus, rabbi, it is good for us to be here
lets make three tents
one for you, one for moses, and one for elijah
for he didnt know what to say, for they were very afraid
a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, this is my beloved son
listen to him
suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except jesus only
as they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the son of man had risen from the dead
they kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant
they asked him, saying, why do the scribes say that elijah must come first?
he said to them, elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things
how is it written about the son of man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?
but i tell you that elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him
coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them
immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him
he asked the scribes, what are you asking them?
one of the multitude answered, teacher, i brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;
and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away
i asked your disciples to cast it out, and they werent able
he answered him, unbelieving generation, how long shall i be with you? how long shall i bear with you? bring him to me
they brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth
he asked his father, how long has it been since this has come to him? he said, from childhood
often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him
but if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us
jesus said to him, if you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes
immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, i believe
help my unbelief!
when jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, you mute and deaf spirit, i command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!
having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him
the boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, he is dead
but jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose
when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, why couldnt we cast it out?
he said to them, this kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting
they went out from there, and passed through galilee
he didnt want anyone to know it
for he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, the son of man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again
but they didnt understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him
he came to capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, what were you arguing among yourselves on the way?
but they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest
he sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, if any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all
he took a little child, and set him in their midst
taking him in his arms, he said to them,
whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesnt receive me, but him who sent me
john said to him, teacher, we saw someone who doesnt follow us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he doesnt follow us
but jesus said, dont forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me
for whoever is not against us is on our side
for whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are christs, most certainly i tell you, he will in no way lose his reward
whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck
if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off
it is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into gehenna, into the unquenchable fire,
where their worm doesnt die, and the fire is not quenched
if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off
it is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched--
where their worm doesnt die, and the fire is not quenched
if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out
it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the gehenna of fire,
where their worm doesnt die, and the fire is not quenched
for everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt
salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another
he arose from there and came into the borders of judea and beyond the jordan
multitudes came together to him again
as he usually did, he was again teaching them
pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?
he answered, what did moses command you?
they said, moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her
but jesus said to them, for your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment
but from the beginning of the creation, god made them male and female
for this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,
and the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh
what therefore god has joined together, let no man separate
in the house, his disciples asked him again about the same matter
he said to them, whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her
if a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery
they were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them
but when jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, allow the little children to come to me! dont forbid them, for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these
most certainly i tell you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child, he will in no way enter into it
he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them
as he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, good teacher, what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life?
jesus said to him, why do you call me good? no one is good except one--god
you know the commandments
do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother
he said to him, teacher, i have observed all these things from my youth
jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, one thing you lack
go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross
but his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions
jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, how difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of god!
the disciples were amazed at his words
but jesus answered again, children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god!
it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
they were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, then who can be saved?
jesus, looking at them, said, with men it is impossible, but not with god, for all things are possible with god
peter began to tell him, behold, we have left all, and have followed you
jesus said, most certainly i tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the good news,
but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life
but many who are first will be last; and the last first
they were on the way, going up to jerusalem; and jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid
he again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him
behold, we are going up to jerusalem
the son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes
they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the gentiles
they will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him
on the third day he will rise again
james and john, the sons of zebedee, came near to him, saying, teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask
he said to them, what do you want me to do for you?
they said to him, grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory
but jesus said to them, you dont know what you are asking
are you able to drink the cup that i drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with?
they said to him, we are able
jesus said to them, you shall indeed drink the cup that i drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with;
but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared
when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards james and john
jesus summoned them, and said to them, you know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them
but it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant
whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all
for the son of man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many
they came to jericho
as he went out from jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of timaeus, bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road
when he heard that it was jesus the nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, jesus, you son of david, have mercy on me!
many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, you son of david, have mercy on me!
jesus stood still, and said, call him
they called the blind man, saying to him, cheer up! get up
he is calling you!
he, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to jesus
jesus asked him, what do you want me to do for you? the blind man said to him, rabboni, that i may see again
jesus said to him, go your way
your faith has made you well
immediately he received his sight, and followed jesus in the way
when they drew near to jerusalem, to bethsphage and bethany, at the mount of olives, he sent two of his disciples,
and said to them, go your way into the village that is opposite you
immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has sat
untie him, and bring him
if anyone asks you, why are you doing this? say, the lord needs him; and immediately he will send him back here
they went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him
some of those who stood there asked them, what are you doing, untying the young donkey?
they said to them just as jesus had said, and they let them go
they brought the young donkey to jesus, and threw their garments on it, and jesus sat on it
many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road
those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, hosanna ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord!
blessed is the kingdom of our father david that is coming in the name of the lord! hosanna in the highest!
jesus entered into the temple in jerusalem
when he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to bethany with the twelve
the next day, when they had come out from bethany, he was hungry
seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it
when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs
jesus told it, may no one ever eat fruit from you again! and his disciples heard it
they came to jerusalem, and jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves
he would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple
he taught, saying to them, isnt it written, my house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a den of robbers!
the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him
for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching
when evening came, he went out of the city
as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots
peter, remembering, said to him, rabbi, look! the fig tree which you cursed has withered away
jesus answered them, have faith in god
for most certainly i tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, be taken up and cast into the sea, and doesnt doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says
therefore i tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them
whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions
but if you do not forgive, neither will your father in heaven forgive your transgressions
they came again to jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,
and they began saying to him, by what authority do you do these things? or who gave you this authority to do these things?
jesus said to them, i will ask you one question
answer me, and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john--was it from heaven, or from men? answer me
they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we should say, from heaven; he will say, why then did you not believe him?
if we should say, from men--they feared the people, for all held john to really be a prophet
they answered jesus, we dont know
jesus said to them, neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things
he began to speak to them in parables
a man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country
when it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard
they took him, beat him, and sent him away empty
again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated
again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some
therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, they will respect my son
but those farmers said among themselves, this is the heir
come, lets kill him, and the inheritance will be ours
they took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard
what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others
havent you even read this scripture
the stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner
this was from the lord, it is marvelous in our eyes?
they tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them
they left him, and went away
they sent some of the pharisees and of the herodians to him, that they might trap him with words
when they had come, they asked him, teacher, we know that you are honest, and dont defer to anyone; for you arent partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of god
is it lawful to pay taxes to caesar, or not?
shall we give, or shall we not give? but he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, why do you test me? bring me a denarius, that i may see it
they brought it
he said to them, whose is this image and inscription? they said to him, caesars
jesus answered them, render to caesar the things that are caesars, and to god the things that are gods
they marveled greatly at him
there came to him sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection
they asked him, saying,
teacher, moses wrote to us, if a mans brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother
there were seven brothers
the first took a wife, and dying left no offspring
the second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him
the third likewise;
and the seven took her and left no children
last of all the woman also died
in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? for the seven had her as a wife
jesus answered them, isnt this because you are mistaken, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of god?
for when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven
but about the dead, that they are raised; havent you read in the book of moses, about the bush, how god spoke to him, saying, i am the god of abraham, the god of isaac, and the god of jacob ?
he is not the god of the dead, but of the living
you are therefore badly mistaken
one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together
knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, which commandment is the greatest of all?
jesus answered, the greatest is, hear, israel, the lord our god, the lord is one
you shall love the lord your god with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength
this is the first commandment
the second is like this, you shall love your neighbor as yourself
there is no other commandment greater than these
the scribe said to him, truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,
and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
when jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, you are not far from the kingdom of god
no one dared ask him any question after that
jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, how is it that the scribes say that the christ is the son of david?
for david himself said in the holy spirit, the lord said to my lord, sit at my right hand, until i make your enemies the footstool of your feet
therefore david himself calls him lord, so how can he be his son? the common people heard him gladly
in his teaching he said to them, beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,
and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts
those who devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers
these will receive greater condemnation
jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury
many who were rich cast in much
a poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin
he called his disciples to himself, and said to them, most certainly i tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,
for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on
as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!
jesus said to him, do you see these great buildings? there will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down
as he sat on the mount of olives opposite the temple, peter, james, john, and andrew asked him privately,
tell us, when will these things be? what is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?
jesus, answering, began to tell them, be careful that no one leads you astray
for many will come in my name, saying, i am he!  and will lead many astray
when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, dont be troubled
for those must happen, but the end is not yet
for nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
there will be earthquakes in various places
there will be famines and troubles
these things are the beginning of birth pains
but watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils
you will be beaten in synagogues
you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them
the good news must first be preached to all the nations
when they lead you away and deliver you up, dont be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour
for it is not you who speak, but the holy spirit
brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child
children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death
you will be hated by all men for my names sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved
but when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains,
and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house
let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak
but woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!
pray that your flight wont be in the winter
for in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which god created until now, and never will be
unless the lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days
then if anyone tells you, look, here is the christ! or, look, there! dont believe it
for there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones
but you watch
behold, i have told you all things beforehand
but in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,
the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken
then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory
then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky
now from the fig tree, learn this parable
when the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near;
even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors
most certainly i say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen
heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away
but of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the son, but only the father
watch, keep alert, and pray; for you dont know when the time is
it is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch
watch therefore, for you dont know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;
lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping
what i tell you, i tell all
watch
it was now two days before the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him
for they said, not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people
while he was at bethany, in the house of simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly
she broke the jar, and poured it over his head
but there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, why has this ointment been wasted?
for this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor
they grumbled against her
but jesus said, leave her alone
why do you trouble her? she has done a good work for me
for you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me
she has done what she could
she has anointed my body beforehand for the burying
most certainly i tell you, wherever this good news may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her
judas iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them
they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money
he sought how he might conveniently deliver him
on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples asked him, where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the passover?
he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water
follow him,
and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, the teacher says, where is the guest room, where i may eat the passover with my disciples?
he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready
get ready for us there
his disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the passover
when it was evening he came with the twelve
as they sat and were eating, jesus said, most certainly i tell you, one of you will betray me--he who eats with me
they began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, surely not i? and another said, surely not i?
he answered them, it is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish
for the son of man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed! it would be better for that man if he had not been born
as they were eating, jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, take, eat
this is my body
he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them
they all drank of it
he said to them, this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many
most certainly i tell you, i will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when i drink it anew in the kingdom of god
when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of olives
jesus said to them, all of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, i will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered
however, after i am raised up, i will go before you into galilee
but peter said to him, although all will be offended, yet i will not
jesus said to him, most certainly i tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times
but he spoke all the more, if i must die with you, i will not deny you
they all said the same thing
they came to a place which was named gethsemane
he said to his disciples, sit here, while i pray
he took with him peter, james, and john, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed
he said to them, my soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death
stay here, and watch
he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him
he said, abba, father, all things are possible to you
please remove this cup from me
however, not what i desire, but what you desire
he came and found them sleeping, and said to peter, simon, are you sleeping? couldnt you watch one hour?
watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation
the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak
again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words
again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didnt know what to answer him
he came the third time, and said to them, sleep on now, and take your rest
it is enough
the hour has come
behold, the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
arise, let us be going
behold, he who betrays me is at hand
immediately, while he was still speaking, judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders
now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, whomever i will kiss, that is he
seize him, and lead him away safely
when he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, rabbi! rabbi! and kissed him
they laid their hands on him, and seized him
but a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear
jesus answered them, have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?
i was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didnt arrest me
but this is so that the scriptures might be fulfilled
they all left him, and fled
a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body
the young men grabbed him,
but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked
they led jesus away to the high priest
all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him
peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest
he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire
now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against jesus to put him to death, and found none
for many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didnt agree with each other
some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,
we heard him say, i will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days i will build another made without hands
even so, their testimony did not agree
the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked jesus, have you no answer? what is it which these testify against you?
but he stayed quiet, and answered nothing
again the high priest asked him, are you the christ, the son of the blessed?
jesus said, i am
you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of the sky
the high priest tore his clothes, and said, what further need have we of witnesses?
you have heard the blasphemy! what do you think? they all condemned him to be worthy of death
some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, prophesy! the officers struck him with the palms of their hands
as peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,
and seeing peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, you were also with the nazarene, jesus!
but he denied it, saying, i neither know, nor understand what you are saying
he went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed
the maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, this is one of them
but he again denied it
after a little while again those who stood by said to peter, you truly are one of them, for you are a galilean, and your speech shows it
but he began to curse, and to swear, i dont know this man of whom you speak!
the rooster crowed the second time
peter remembered the word, how that jesus said to him, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times
when he thought about that, he wept
immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to pilate
pilate asked him, are you the king of the jews? he answered, so you say
the chief priests accused him of many things
pilate again asked him, have you no answer? see how many things they testify against you!
but jesus made no further answer, so that pilate marveled
now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him
there was one called barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder
the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them
pilate answered them, saying, do you want me to release to you the king of the jews?
for he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up
but the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release barabbas to them instead
pilate again asked them, what then should i do to him whom you call the king of the jews?
they cried out again, crucify him!
pilate said to them, why, what evil has he done? but they cried out exceedingly, crucify him!
pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released barabbas to them, and handed over jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified
the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort
they clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him
they began to salute him, hail, king of the jews!
they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him
when they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him
they led him out to crucify him
they compelled one passing by, coming from the country, simon of cyrene, the father of alexander and rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross
they brought him to the place called golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull
they offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didnt take it
crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take
it was the third hour, and they crucified him
the superscription of his accusation was written over him, the king of the jews
with him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left
the scripture was fulfilled, which says, he was numbered with transgressors
those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, ha! you who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
save yourself, and come down from the cross!
likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, he saved others
he cant save himself
let the christ, the king of israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him
those who were crucified with him insulted him
when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, my god, my god, why have you forsaken me?
some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, behold, he is calling elijah
one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, let him be
lets see whether elijah comes to take him down
jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit
the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom
when the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, truly this man was the son of god!
there were also women watching from afar, among whom were both mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james the less and of joses, and salome;
who, when he was in galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to jerusalem
when evening had now come, because it was the preparation day, that is, the day before the sabbath,
joseph of arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the kingdom of god, came
he boldly went in to pilate, and asked for jesus body
pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long
when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to joseph
he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock
he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb
mary magdalene and mary, the mother of joses, saw where he was laid
when the sabbath was past, mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james, and salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him
very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen
they were saying among themselves, who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?
for it was very big
looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back
entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed
he said to them, dont be amazed
you seek jesus, the nazarene, who has been crucified
he has risen
he is not here
behold, the place where they laid him!
but go, tell his disciples and peter, he goes before you into galilee
there you will see him, as he said to you
they went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them
they said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid
now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to mary magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons
she went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept
when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved
after these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country
they went away and told it to the rest
they didnt believe them, either
afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didnt believe those who had seen him after he had risen
he said to them, go into all the world, and preach the good news to the whole creation
he who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned
these signs will accompany those who believe
in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;
they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover
so then the lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of god
they went out, and preached everywhere, the lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed
amen
since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,
it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent theophilus;
that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed
there was in the days of herod, the king of judea, a certain priest named zacharias, of the priestly division of abijah
he had a wife of the daughters of aaron, and her name was elizabeth
they were both righteous before god, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord
but they had no child, because elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years
now it happened, while he executed the priests office before god in the order of his division,
according to the custom of the priests office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the lord and burn incense
the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense
an angel of the lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense
zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him
but the angel said to him, dont be afraid, zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name john
you will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth
for he will be great in the sight of the lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink
he will be filled with the holy spirit, even from his mothers womb
he will turn many of the children of israel to the lord, their god
he will go before him in the spirit and power of elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the lord
zacharias said to the angel, how can i be sure of this? for i am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years
the angel answered him, i am gabriel, who stands in the presence of god
i was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news
behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didnt believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time
the people were waiting for zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple
when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple
he continued making signs to them, and remained mute
it happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house
after these days elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,
thus has the lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men
now in the sixth month, the angel gabriel was sent from god to a city of galilee, named nazareth,
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was joseph, of the house of david
the virgins name was mary
having come in, the angel said to her, rejoice, you highly favored one! the lord is with you
blessed are you among women!
but when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be
the angel said to her, dont be afraid, mary, for you have found favor with god
behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name jesus
he will be great, and will be called the son of the most high
the lord god will give him the throne of his father, david,
and he will reign over the house of jacob forever
there will be no end to his kingdom
mary said to the angel, how can this be, seeing i am a virgin?
the angel answered her, the holy spirit will come on you, and the power of the most high will overshadow you
therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the son of god
behold, elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren
for everything spoken by god is possible
mary said, behold, the handmaid of the lord; be it to me according to your word
the angel departed from her
mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of judah,
and entered into the house of zacharias and greeted elizabeth
it happened, when elizabeth heard marys greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit
she called out with a loud voice, and said, blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
why am i so favored, that the mother of my lord should come to me?
for behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the lord!
mary said, my soul magnifies the lord
my spirit has rejoiced in god my savior,
for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid
for behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed
for he who is mighty has done great things for me
holy is his name
his mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him
he has shown strength with his arm
he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts
he has put down princes from their thrones
and has exalted the lowly
he has filled the hungry with good things
he has sent the rich away empty
he has given help to israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,
as he spoke to our fathers, to abraham and his seed forever
mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house
now the time that elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son
her neighbors and her relatives heard that the lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her
it happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him zacharias, after the name of the father
his mother answered, not so; but he will be called john
they said to her, there is no one among your relatives who is called by this name
they made signs to his father, what he would have him called
he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, his name is john
they all marveled
his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing god
fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of judea
all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, what then will this child be? the hand of the lord was with him
his father, zacharias, was filled with the holy spirit, and prophesied, saying,
blessed be the lord, the god of israel, for he has visited and worked redemption for his people;
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david
,
salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
to show mercy towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant,
the oath which he spoke to abraham, our father,
to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear,
in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life
and you, child, will be called a prophet of the most high, for you will go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways,
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,
because of the tender mercy of our god, whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace
the child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to israel
now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from caesar augustus that all the world should be enrolled
this was the first enrollment made when quirinius was governor of syria
all went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city
joseph also went up from galilee, out of the city of nazareth, into judea, to the city of david, which is called bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of david;
to enroll himself with mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant
it happened, while they were there, that the day had come that she should give birth
she brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn
there were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock
behold, an angel of the lord stood by them, and the glory of the lord shone around them, and they were terrified
the angel said to them, dont be afraid, for behold, i bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people
for there is born to you, this day, in the city of david, a savior, who is christ the lord
this is the sign to you
you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough
suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising god, and saying,
glory to god in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men
it happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, lets go to bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the lord has made known to us
they came with haste, and found both mary and joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough
when they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child
all who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds
but mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart
the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them
when eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb
when the days of their purification according to the law of moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to jerusalem, to present him to the lord
,
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons
behold, there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon
this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of israel, and the holy spirit was on him
it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the lords christ
he came in the spirit into the temple
when the parents brought in the child, jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,
then he received him into his arms, and blessed god, and said,
now you are releasing your servant, master, according to your word, in peace;
for my eyes have seen your salvation,
which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people israel
joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,
and simeon blessed them, and said to mary, his mother, behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in israel, and for a sign which is spoken against
yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
there was one anna, a prophetess, the daughter of phanuel, of the tribe of asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didnt depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day
coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in jerusalem
when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the lord, they returned into galilee, to their own city, nazareth
the child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of god was upon him
his parents went every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover
when he was twelve years old, they went up to jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem
joseph and his mother didnt know it,
but supposing him to be in the company, they went a days journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances
when they didnt find him, they returned to jerusalem, looking for him
it happened after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions
all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers
when they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, son, why have you treated us this way? behold, your father and i were anxiously looking for you
he said to them, why were you looking for me? didnt you know that i must be in my fathers house?
they didnt understand the saying which he spoke to them
and he went down with them, and came to nazareth
he was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart
and jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with god and men
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar, pontius pilate being governor of judea, and herod being tetrarch of galilee, and his brother philip tetrarch of the region of ituraea and trachonitis, and lysanias tetrarch of abilene,
in the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas, the word of god came to john, the son of zacharias, in the wilderness
he came into all the region around the jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins
as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the lord
make his paths straight
every valley will be filled
every mountain and hill will be brought low
the crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth
all flesh will see gods salvation
he said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, you offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and dont begin to say among yourselves, we have abraham for our father; for i tell you that god is able to raise up children to abraham from these stones!
even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees
every tree therefore that doesnt bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire
the multitudes asked him, what then must we do?
he answered them, he who has two coats, let him give to him who has none
he who has food, let him do likewise
tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, teacher, what must we do?
he said to them, collect no more than that which is appointed to you
soldiers also asked him, saying, what about us? what must we do? he said to them, extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully
be content with your wages
as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning john, whether perhaps he was the christ,
john answered them all, i indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than i, the latchet of whose sandals i am not worthy to loosen
he will baptize you in the holy spirit and fire,
whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,
but herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for herodias, his brothers wife, and for all the evil things which herod had done,
added this also to them all, that he shut up john in prison
now it happened, when all the people were baptized, jesus also had been baptized, and was praying
the sky was opened,
and the holy spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying you are my beloved son
in you i am well pleased
jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son  of joseph, the son of heli,
the son of matthat, the son of levi, the son of melchi, the son of jannai, the son of joseph,
the son of mattathias, the son of amos, the son of nahum, the son of esli, the son of naggai,
the son of maath, the son of mattathias, the son of semein, the son of joseph, the son of judah,

the son of melchi, the son of addi, the son of cosam, the son of elmodam, the son of er,
the son of jose, the son of eliezer, the son of jorim, the son of matthat, the son of levi,
the son of simeon, the son of judah, the son of joseph, the son of jonan, the son of eliakim,
the son of melea, the son of menan, the son of mattatha, the son of nathan, the son of david,
the son of jesse, the son of obed, the son of boaz, the son of salmon, the son of nahshon,
the son of amminadab, the son of aram, the son of hezron, the son of perez, the son of judah,
the son of jacob, the son of isaac, the son of abraham, the son of terah, the son of nahor,
the son of serug, the son of reu, the son of peleg, the son of eber, the son of shelah,
the son of cainan, the son of arphaxad, the son of shem, the son of noah, the son of lamech,
the son of methuselah, the son of enoch, the son of jared, the son of mahalaleel, the son of cainan,
the son of enos, the son of seth, the son of adam, the son of god
jesus, full of the holy spirit, returned from the jordan, and was led by the spirit into the wilderness
for forty days, being tempted by the devil
he ate nothing in those days
afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry
the devil said to him, if you are the son of god, command this stone to become bread
jesus answered him, saying, it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of god
the devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
the devil said to him, i will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and i give it to whomever i want
if you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours
jesus answered him, get behind me satan! for it is written, you shall worship the lord your god, and you shall serve him only
he led him to jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, if you are the son of god, cast yourself down from here,
for it is written, he will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;
and, on their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone
jesus answering, said to him, it has been said, you shall not tempt the lord your god
when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time
jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area
he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all
he came to nazareth, where he had been brought up
he entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read
the book of the prophet isaiah was handed to him
he opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
the spirit of the lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor
he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,
and to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord
he closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down
the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him
he began to tell them, today, this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing
all testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, isnt this josephs son?
he said to them, doubtless you will tell me this parable, physician, heal yourself! whatever we have heard done at capernaum, do also here in your hometown
he said, most certainly i tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown
but truly i tell you, there were many widows in israel in the days of elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land
elijah was sent to none of them, except to zarephath, in the land of sidon, to a woman who was a widow
there were many lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except naaman, the syrian
they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things
they rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff
but he, passing through their midst, went his way
he came down to capernaum, a city of galilee
he was teaching them on the sabbath day,
and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority
in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
saying, ah! what have we to do with you, jesus of nazareth? have you come to destroy us? i know you who you are
the holy one of god!
jesus rebuked him, saying, be silent, and come out of him! when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm
amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, what is this word? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!
news about him went out into every place of the surrounding region
he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into simons house
simons mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her
he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her
immediately she rose up and served them
when the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them
demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, you are the christ, the son of god! rebuking them, he didnt allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the christ
when it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldnt go away from them
but he said to them, i must preach the good news of the kingdom of god to the other cities also
for this reason i have been sent
he was preaching in the synagogues of galilee
now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of god, that he was standing by the lake of gennesaret
he saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets
he entered into one of the boats, which was simons, and asked him to put out a little from the land
he sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat
when he had finished speaking, he said to simon, put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch
simon answered him, master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word i will let down the net
when they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking
they beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them
they came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink
but simon peter, when he saw it, fell down at jesus knees, saying, depart from me, for i am a sinful man, lord
for he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;
and so also were james and john, sons of zebedee, who were partners with simon
jesus said to simon, dont be afraid
from now on you will be catching people alive
when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him
it happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy
when he saw jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, lord, if you want to, you can make me clean
he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, i want to
be made clean
immediately the leprosy left him
he commanded him to tell no one, but go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what moses commanded, for a testimony to them
but the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities
but he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed
it happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of galilee, judea, and jerusalem
the power of the lord was with him to heal them
behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before jesus
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before jesus
seeing their faith, he said to him, man, your sins are forgiven you
the scribes and the pharisees began to reason, saying, who is this that speaks blasphemies? who can forgive sins, but god alone?
but jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, why are you reasoning so in your hearts?
which is easier to say, your sins are forgiven you; or to say, arise and walk?
but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, i tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house
immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying god
amazement took hold on all, and they glorified god
they were filled with fear, saying, we have seen strange things today
after these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, follow me!
he left everything, and rose up and followed him
levi made a great feast for him in his house
there was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them
their scribes and the pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?
jesus answered them, those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do
i have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance
they said to him, why do johns disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the pharisees, but yours eat and drink?
he said to them, can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
but the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them
then they will fast in those days
he also told a parable to them
no one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old
no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed
but new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved
no man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, the old is better
now it happened on the second sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields
his disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands
but some of the pharisees said to them, why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?
jesus, answering them, said, havent you read what david did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;
how he entered into gods house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?
he said to them, the son of man is lord of the sabbath
it also happened on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught
there was a man there, and his right hand was withered
the scribes and the pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him
but he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, rise up, and stand in the middle
he arose and stood
then jesus said to them, i will ask you something
is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill?
he looked around at them all, and said to the man, stretch out your hand
he did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other
but they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to jesus
it happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to god
when it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles
simon, whom he also named peter; andrew, his brother; james; john; philip; bartholomew;
matthew; thomas; james, the son of alphaeus; simon, who was called the zealot;
judas the son of james; and judas iscariot, who also became a traitor
he came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all judea and jerusalem, and the sea coast of tyre and sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;
as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed
all the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all
he lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of god
blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled
blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh
blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the son of mans sake
rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets
but woe to you who are rich! for you have received your consolation
woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry
woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep
woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets
but i tell you who hear
love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you
to him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, dont withhold your coat also
give to everyone who asks you, and dont ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again
as you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them
if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? for even sinners love those who love them
if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? for even sinners do the same
if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much
but love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the most high; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil
therefore be merciful, even as your father is also merciful
dont judge, and you wont be judged
dont condemn, and you wont be condemned
set free, and you will be set free
give, and it will be given to you
good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you
for with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you
he spoke a parable to them
can the blind guide the blind? wont they both fall into a pit?
a disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher
why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye, but dont consider the beam that is in your own eye?
or how can you tell your brother, brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye, when you yourself dont see the beam that is in your own eye? you hypocrite! first remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brothers eye
for there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit
for each tree is known by its own fruit
for people dont gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush
the good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks
why do you call me, lord, lord, and dont do the things which i say?
everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, i will show you who he is like
he is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock
when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock
but he who hears, and doesnt do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great
after he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into capernaum
a certain centurions servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death
when he heard about jesus, he sent to him elders of the jews, asking him to come and save his servant
when they came to jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, he is worthy for you to do this for him,
for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us
jesus went with them
when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, lord, dont trouble yourself, for i am not worthy for you to come under my roof
therefore i didnt even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed
for i also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers
i tell this one, go! and he goes; and to another, come! and he comes; and to my servant, do this, and he does it
when jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, i tell you, i have not found such great faith, no, not in israel
those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well
it happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called nain
many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him
now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow
many people of the city were with her
when the lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, dont cry
he came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still
he said, young man, i tell you, arise!
he who was dead sat up, and began to speak
and he gave him to his mother
fear took hold of all, and they glorified god, saying, a great prophet has arisen among us! and, god has visited his people!
this report went out concerning him in the whole of judea, and in all the surrounding region
the disciples of john told him about all these things
john, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to jesus, saying, are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?
when the men had come to him, they said, john the baptizer has sent us to you, saying, are you he who comes, or should we look for another?
in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight
jesus answered them, go and tell john the things which you have seen and heard
that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them
blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me
when johns messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about john, what did you go out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken by the wind?
but what did you go out to see? a man clothed in soft clothing? behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings courts
but what did you go out to see? a prophet? yes, i tell you, and much more than a prophet
this is he of whom it is written, behold, i send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you
for i tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptizer, yet he who is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
when all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared god to be just, having been baptized with johns baptism
but the pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of god, not being baptized by him themselves
to what then will i liken the people of this generation? what are they like?
they are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, we piped to you, and you didnt dance
we mourned, and you didnt weep
for john the baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, he has a demon
the son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!
wisdom is justified by all her children
one of the pharisees invited him to eat with him
he entered into the pharisees house, and sat at the table
behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the pharisees house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment
standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment
now when the pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, this man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner
jesus answered him, simon, i have something to tell you
he said, teacher, say on
a certain lender had two debtors
the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty
when they couldnt pay, he forgave them both
which of them therefore will love him most?
simon answered, he, i suppose, to whom he forgave the most
he said to him, you have judged correctly
turning to the woman, he said to simon, do you see this woman? i entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head
you gave me no kiss, but she, since the time i came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet
you didnt anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment
therefore i tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much
but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little
he said to her, your sins are forgiven
those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, who is this who even forgives sins?
he said to the woman, your faith has saved you
go in peace
it happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god
with him were the twelve,
and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities
mary who was called magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;
and joanna, the wife of chuzas, herods steward; susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions
when a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable
the farmer went out to sow his seed
as he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it
other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture
other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it
other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times
as he said these things, he called out, he who has ears to hear, let him hear!
then his disciples asked him, what does this parable mean?
he said, to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god, but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand
now the parable is this
the seed is the word of god
those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved
those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation
that which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity
that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience
no one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light
for nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light
be careful therefore how you hear
for whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesnt have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has
his mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd
it was told him by some saying, your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you
but he answered them, my mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of god, and do it
now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, lets go over to the other side of the lake
so they launched out
but as they sailed, he fell asleep
a wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water
they came to him, and awoke him, saying, master, master, we are dying! he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm
he said to them, where is your faith? being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?
they arrived at the country of the gadarenes, which is opposite galilee
when jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him
he wore no clothes, and didnt live in a house, but in the tombs
when he saw jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, what do i have to do with you, jesus, you son of the most high god? i beg you, dont torment me!
for jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man
for the unclean spirit had often seized the man
he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters
breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert
jesus asked him, what is your name? he said, legion, for many demons had entered into him
they begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss
now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those
he allowed them
the demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned
when those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country
people went out to see what had happened
they came to jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at jesus feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid
those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed
all the people of the surrounding country of the gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid
he entered into the boat, and returned
but the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but jesus sent him away, saying,
return to your house, and declare what great things god has done for you
he went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things jesus had done for him
it happened, when jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him
behold, there came a man named jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue
he fell down at jesus feet, and begged him to come into his house,
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying
but as he went, the multitudes pressed against him
a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,
came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped
jesus said, who touched me? when all denied it, peter and those with him said, master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, who touched me?
but jesus said, someone did touch me, for i perceived that power has gone out of me
when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately
he said to her, daughter, cheer up
your faith has made you well
go in peace
while he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogues house came, saying to him, your daughter is dead
dont trouble the teacher
but jesus hearing it, answered him, dont be afraid
only believe, and she will be healed
when he came to the house, he didnt allow anyone to enter in, except peter, john, james, the father of the child, and her mother
all were weeping and mourning her, but he said, dont weep
she isnt dead, but sleeping
they were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead
but he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, child, arise!
her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately
he commanded that something be given to her to eat
her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done
he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases
he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of god, and to heal the sick
he said to them, take nothing for your journey--neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece
into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there
as many as dont receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them
they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the good news, and healing everywhere
now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that john had risen from the dead,
and by some that elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again
herod said, john i beheaded, but who is this, about whom i hear such things? he sought to see him
the apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done
he took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called bethsaida
but the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him
he welcomed them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of god, and he cured those who needed healing
the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place
but he said to them, you give them something to eat
they said, we have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people
for they were about five thousand men
he said to his disciples, make them sit down in groups of about fifty each
they did so, and made them all sit down
he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude
they ate, and were all filled
they gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over
it happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, who do the multitudes say that i am?
they answered, john the baptizer, but others say, elijah, and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again
he said to them, but who do you say that i am? peter answered, the christ of god
but he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,
saying, the son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up
he said to all, if anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me
for whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it
for what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?
for whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the son of man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the father, and of the holy angels
but i tell you the truth
there are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the kingdom of god
it happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him peter, john, and james, and went up onto the mountain to pray
as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling
behold, two men were talking with him, who were moses and elijah,
who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem
now peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him
it happened, as they were parting from him, that peter said to jesus, master, it is good for us to be here
lets make three tents
one for you, and one for moses, and one for elijah, not knowing what he said
while he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud
a voice came out of the cloud, saying, this is my beloved son
listen to him!
when the voice came, jesus was found alone
they were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen
it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him
behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, teacher, i beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child
behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely
i begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldnt
jesus answered, faithless and perverse generation, how long shall i be with you and bear with you? bring your son here
while he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently
but jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father
they were all astonished at the majesty of god
but while all were marveling at all the things which jesus did, he said to his disciples,
let these words sink into your ears, for the son of man will be delivered up into the hands of men
but they didnt understand this saying
it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying
there arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest
jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,
and said to them, whoever receives this little child in my name receives me
whoever receives me receives him who sent me
for whoever is least among you all, this one will be great
john answered, master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesnt follow with us
jesus said to him, dont forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us
it came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to jerusalem,
and sent messengers before his face
they went, and entered into a village of the samaritans, so as to prepare for him
they didnt receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards jerusalem
when his disciples, james and john, saw this, they said, lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as elijah did?
but he turned and rebuked them, you dont know of what kind of spirit you are
for the son of man didnt come to destroy mens lives, but to save them
they went to another village
as they went on the way, a certain man said to him, i want to follow you wherever you go, lord
jesus said to him, the foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the son of man has no place to lay his head
he said to another, follow me! but he said, lord, allow me first to go and bury my father
but jesus said to him, leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of god
another also said, i want to follow you, lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house
but jesus said to him, no one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of god
now after these things, the lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place, where he was about to come
then he said to them, the harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few
pray therefore to the lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest
go your ways
behold, i send you out as lambs among wolves
carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals
greet no one on the way
into whatever house you enter, first say, peace be to this house
if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you
remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages
dont go from house to house
into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you
heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, the kingdom of god has come near to you
but into whatever city you enter, and they dont receive you, go out into its streets and say,
even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you
nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of god has come near to you
i tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city
woe to you, chorazin! woe to you, bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes
but it will be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the judgment than for you
you, capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to hades
whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me
whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me
the seventy returned with joy, saying, lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!
he said to them, i saw satan having fallen like lightning from heaven
behold, i give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy
nothing will in any way hurt you
nevertheless, dont rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven
in that same hour jesus rejoiced in the holy spirit, and said, i thank you, o father, lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children
yes, father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight
turning to the disciples, he said, all things have been delivered to me by my father
no one knows who the son is, except the father, and who the father is, except the son, and he to whomever the son desires to reveal him
turning to the disciples, he said privately, blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,
for i tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didnt see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didnt hear them
behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, teacher, what shall i do to inherit eternal life?
he said to him, what is written in the law? how do you read it?
he answered, you shall love the lord your god with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself
he said to him, you have answered correctly
do this, and you will live
but he, desiring to justify himself, asked jesus, who is my neighbor?
jesus answered, a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead
by chance a certain priest was going down that way
when he saw him, he passed by on the other side
in the same way a levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side
but a certain samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was
when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine
he set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him
on the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, take care of him
whatever you spend beyond that, i will repay you when i return
now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?
he said, he who showed mercy on him
then jesus said to him, go and do likewise
it happened as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named martha received him into her house
she had a sister called mary, who also sat at jesus feet, and heard his word
but martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, lord, dont you care that my sister left me to serve alone? ask her therefore to help me
jesus answered her, martha, martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,
but one thing is needed
mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her
it happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, lord, teach us to pray, just as john also taught his disciples
he said to them, when you pray, say, our father in heaven, may your name be kept holy
may your kingdom come
may your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven
give us day by day our daily bread
forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us
bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one
he said to them, which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and i have nothing to set before him,
and he from within will answer and say, dont bother me
the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed
i cant get up and give it to you?
i tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs
i tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you
keep seeking, and you will find
keep knocking, and it will be opened to you
for everyone who asks receives
he who seeks finds
to him who knocks it will be opened
which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? or if he asks for a fish, he wont give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?
or if he asks for an egg, he wont give him a scorpion, will he?
if you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly father give the holy spirit to those who ask him?
he was casting out a demon, and it was mute
it happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled
but some of them said, he casts out demons by beelzebul, the prince of the demons
others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven
but he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation
a house divided against itself falls
if satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? for you say that i cast out demons by beelzebul
but if i cast out demons by beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore will they be your judges
but if i by the finger of god cast out demons, then the kingdom of god has come to you
when the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe
but when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils
he that is not with me is against me
he who doesnt gather with me scatters
the unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, i will turn back to my house from which i came out
when he returns, he finds it swept and put in order
then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there
the last state of that man becomes worse than the first
it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!
but he said, on the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of god, and keep it
when the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, this is an evil generation
it seeks after a sign
no sign will be given to it but the sign of jonah, the prophet
for even as jonah became a sign to the ninevites, so will also the son of man be to this generation
the queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them
for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon; and behold, one greater than solomon is here
the men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it
for they repented at the preaching of jonah, and behold, one greater than jonah is here
no one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light
the lamp of the body is the eye
therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness
therefore see whether the light that is in you isnt darkness
if therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light
now as he spoke, a certain pharisee asked him to dine with him
he went in, and sat at the table
when the pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner
the lord said to him, now you pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness
you foolish ones, didnt he who made the outside make the inside also?
but give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you
but woe to you pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of god
you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone
woe to you pharisees! for you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces
woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them dont know it
one of the lawyers answered him, teacher, in saying this you insult us also
he said, woe to you lawyers also! for you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves wont even lift one finger to help carry those burdens
woe to you! for you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them
so you testify and consent to the works of your fathers
for they killed them, and you build their tombs
therefore also the wisdom of god said, i will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,
that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
from the blood of abel to the blood of zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary
yes, i tell you, it will be required of this generation
woe to you lawyers! for you took away the key of knowledge
you didnt enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered
as he said these things to them, the scribes and the pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;
lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him
meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, beware of the yeast of the pharisees, which is hypocrisy
but there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light
what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops
i tell you, my friends, dont be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do
but i will warn you whom you should fear
fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into gehenna
yes, i tell you, fear him
arent five sparrows sold for two assaria coins ? not one of them is forgotten by god
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered
therefore dont be afraid
you are of more value than many sparrows
i tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the son of man also confess before the angels of god;
but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of god
everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the holy spirit will not be forgiven
when they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, dont be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;
for the holy spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say
one of the multitude said to him, teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me
but he said to him, man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?
he said to them, beware! keep yourselves from covetousness, for a mans life doesnt consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses
he spoke a parable to them, saying, the ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly
he reasoned within himself, saying, what will i do, because i dont have room to store my crops?
he said, this is what i will do
i will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there i will store all my grain and my goods
i will tell my soul, soul, you have many goods laid up for many years
take your ease, eat, drink, be merry
but god said to him, you foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you
the things which you have prepared--whose will they be?
so is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward god
he said to his disciples, therefore i tell you, dont be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear
life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing
consider the ravens
they dont sow, they dont reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and god feeds them
how much more valuable are you than birds!
which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?
if then you arent able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?
consider the lilies, how they grow
they dont toil, neither do they spin; yet i tell you, even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
but if this is how god clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, o you of little faith?
dont seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious
for the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your father knows that you need these things
but seek gods kingdom, and all these things will be added to you
dont be afraid, little flock, for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy
make for yourselves purses which dont grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesnt fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys
for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also
let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning
be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him
blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes
most certainly i tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them
they will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so
but know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into
therefore be ready also, for the son of man is coming in an hour that you dont expect him
peter said to him, lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?
the lord said, who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?
blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes
truly i tell you, that he will set him over all that he has
but if that servant says in his heart, my lord delays his coming, and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,
then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isnt expecting him, and in an hour that he doesnt know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful
that servant, who knew his lords will, and didnt prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,
but he who didnt know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes
to whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked
i came to throw fire on the earth
i wish it were already kindled
but i have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed i am until it is accomplished!
do you think that i have come to give peace in the earth? i tell you, no, but rather division
for from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three
they will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law
he said to the multitudes also, when you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, a shower is coming, and so it happens
when a south wind blows, you say, there will be a scorching heat, and it happens
you hypocrites! you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you dont interpret this time?
why dont you judge for yourselves what is right?
for when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison
i tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny
now there were some present at the same time who told him about the galileans, whose blood pilate had mixed with their sacrifices
jesus answered them, do you think that these galileans were worse sinners than all the other galileans, because they suffered such things?
i tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way
or those eighteen, on whom the tower in siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in jerusalem?
i tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way
he spoke this parable
a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none
he said to the vine dresser, behold, these three years i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none
cut it down
why does it waste the soil?
he answered, lord, leave it alone this year also, until i dig around it, and fertilize it
if it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down
he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day
behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up
when jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, woman, you are freed from your infirmity
he laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified god
the ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because jesus had healed on the sabbath, said to the multitude, there are six days in which men ought to work
therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the sabbath day!
therefore the lord answered him, you hypocrites! doesnt each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the sabbath, and lead him away to water?
ought not this woman, being a daughter of abraham, whom satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the sabbath day?
as he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him
he said, what is the kingdom of god like? to what shall i compare it?
it is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden
it grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches
again he said, to what shall i compare the kingdom of god?
it is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened
he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to jerusalem
one said to him, lord, are they few who are saved? he said to them,
strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, i tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able
when once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, lord, lord, open to us! then he will answer and tell you, i dont know you or where you come from
then you will begin to say, we ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets
he will say, i tell you, i dont know where you come from
depart from me, all you workers of iniquity
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see abraham, isaac, jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of god, and yourselves being thrown outside
they will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of god
behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last
on that same day, some pharisees came, saying to him, get out of here, and go away, for herod wants to kill you
he said to them, go and tell that fox, behold, i cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day i complete my mission
nevertheless i must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it cant be that a prophet perish outside of jerusalem
jerusalem, jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! how often i wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!
behold, your house is left to you desolate
i tell you, you will not see me, until you say, blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord!
it happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him
behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him
jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and pharisees, saying, is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?
but they were silent
he took him, and healed him, and let him go
he answered them, which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, wouldnt immediately pull him out on a sabbath day?
they couldnt answer him regarding these things
he spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,
when you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, dont sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,
and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, make room for this person
then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place
but when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, friend, move up higher
then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you
for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
he also said to the one who had invited him, when you make a dinner or a supper, dont call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back
but when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;
and you will be blessed, because they dont have the resources to repay you
for you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous
when one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, blessed is he who will feast in the kingdom of god!
but he said to him, a certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people
he sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, come, for everything is ready now
they all as one began to make excuses
the first said to him, i have bought a field, and i must go and see it
please have me excused
another said, i have bought five yoke of oxen, and i must go try them out
please have me excused
another said, i have married a wife, and therefore i cant come
that servant came, and told his lord these things
then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame
the servant said, lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room
the lord said to the servant, go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled
for i tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper
now great multitudes were going with him
he turned and said to them,
if anyone comes to me, and doesnt disregard his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cant be my disciple
whoever doesnt bear his own cross, and come after me, cant be my disciple
for which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesnt first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?
or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,
saying, this man began to build, and wasnt able to finish
or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace
so therefore whoever of you who doesnt renounce all that he has, he cant be my disciple
salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile
it is thrown out
he who has ears to hear, let him hear
now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him
the pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, this man welcomes sinners, and eats with them
he told them this parable
which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldnt leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?
when he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing
when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, rejoice with me, for i have found my sheep which was lost!
i tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance
or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldnt light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, rejoice with me, for i have found the drachma which i had lost
even so, i tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner repenting
he said, a certain man had two sons
the younger of them said to his father, father, give me my share of your property
he divided his livelihood between them
not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country
there he wasted his property with riotous living
when he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need
he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs
he wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any
but when he came to himself he said, how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare, and im dying with hunger!
i will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, father, i have sinned against heaven, and in your sight
i am no more worthy to be called your son
make me as one of your hired servants
he arose, and came to his father
but while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him
the son said to him, father, i have sinned against heaven, and in your sight
i am no longer worthy to be called your son
but the father said to his servants, bring out the best robe, and put it on him
put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet
bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;
for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again
he was lost, and is found
they began to celebrate
now his elder son was in the field
as he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing
he called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on
he said to him, your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy
but he was angry, and would not go in
therefore his father came out, and begged him
but he answered his father, behold, these many years i have served you, and i never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that i might celebrate with my friends
but when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him
he said to him, son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours
but it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again
he was lost, and is found
he also said to his disciples, there was a certain rich man who had a manager
an accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions
he called him, and said to him, what is this that i hear about you? give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager
the manager said within himself, what will i do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? i dont have strength to dig
i am ashamed to beg
i know what i will do, so that when i am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses
calling each one of his lords debtors to him, he said to the first, how much do you owe to my lord?
he said, a hundred batos of oil
he said to him, take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty
then he said to another, how much do you owe? he said, a hundred cors of wheat
he said to him, take your bill, and write eighty
his lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light
i tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents
he who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much
he who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much
if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
if you have not been faithful in that which is anothers, who will give you that which is your own?
no servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other
you arent able to serve god and mammon 
the pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him
he said to them, you are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but god knows your hearts
for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of god
the law and the prophets were until john
from that time the good news of the kingdom of god is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it
but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall
everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery
he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery
now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day
a certain beggar, named lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores,
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table
yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores
it happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to abrahams bosom
the rich man also died, and was buried
in hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw abraham far off, and lazarus at his bosom
he cried and said, father abraham, have mercy on me, and send lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! for i am in anguish in this flame
but abraham said, son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and lazarus, in the same way, bad things
but now here he is comforted and you are in anguish
besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us
he said, i ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my fathers house;
for i have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they wont also come into this place of torment
but abraham said to him, they have moses and the prophets
let them listen to them
he said, no, father abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent
he said to him, if they dont listen to moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead
he said to the disciples, it is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!
it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble
be careful
if your brother sins against you, rebuke him
if he repents, forgive him
if he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, i repent, you shall forgive him
the apostles said to the lord, increase our faith
the lord said, if you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you
but who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, come immediately and sit down at the table,
and will not rather tell him, prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while i eat and drink
afterward you shall eat and drink?
does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? i think not
even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, we are unworthy servants
we have done our duty
it happened as he was on his way to jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of samaria and galilee
as he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance
they lifted up their voices, saying, jesus, master, have mercy on us!
when he saw them, he said to them, go and show yourselves to the priests
it happened that as they went, they were cleansed
one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying god with a loud voice
he fell on his face at jesus feet, giving him thanks; and he was a samaritan
jesus answered, werent the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
were there none found who returned to give glory to god, except this stranger?
then he said to him, get up, and go your way
your faith has healed you
being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god would come, he answered them, the kingdom of god doesnt come with observation;
neither will they say, look, here! or, look, there! for behold, the kingdom of god is within you
he said to the disciples, the days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the son of man, and you will not see it
they will tell you, look, here! or look, there! dont go away, nor follow after them,
for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the son of man be in his day
but first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation
as it happened in the days of noah, even so will it be also in the days of the son of man
they ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all
likewise, even as it happened in the days of lot
they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
but in the day that lot went out from sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all
it will be the same way in the day that the son of man is revealed
in that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away
let him who is in the field likewise not turn back
remember lots wife!
whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it
i tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed
the one will be taken, and the other will be left
there will be two grinding grain together
one will be taken, and the other will be left
they, answering, asked him, where, lord? he said to them, where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together
he also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,
saying, there was a judge in a certain city who didnt fear god, and didnt respect man
a widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, defend me from my adversary!
he wouldnt for a while, but afterward he said to himself, though i neither fear god, nor respect man,
yet because this widow bothers me, i will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming
the lord said, listen to what the unrighteous judge says
wont god avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?
i tell you that he will avenge them quickly
nevertheless, when the son of man comes, will he find faith on the earth?
he spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others
two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a pharisee, and the other was a tax collector
the pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this
god, i thank you, that i am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector
i fast twice a week
i give tithes of all that i get
but the tax collector, standing far away, wouldnt even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, god, be merciful to me, a sinner!
i tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted
they were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them
but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them
jesus summoned them, saying, allow the little children to come to me, and dont hinder them, for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these
most certainly, i tell you, whoever doesnt receive the kingdom of god like a little child, he will in no way enter into it
a certain ruler asked him, saying, good teacher, what shall i do to inherit eternal life?
jesus asked him, why do you call me good? no one is good, except one--god
you know the commandments
dont commit adultery, dont murder, dont steal, dont give false testimony, honor your father and your mother
he said, i have observed all these things from my youth up
when jesus heard these things, he said to him, you still lack one thing
sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor
you will have treasure in heaven
come, follow me
but when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich
jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, how hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of god!
for it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
those who heard it said, then who can be saved?
but he said, the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
peter said, look, we have left everything, and followed you
he said to them, most certainly i tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of gods sake,
who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life
he took the twelve aside, and said to them, behold, we are going up to jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the son of man will be completed
for he will be delivered up to the gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on
they will scourge and kill him
on the third day, he will rise again
they understood none of these things
this saying was hidden from them, and they didnt understand the things that were said
it happened, as he came near jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging
hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant
they told him that jesus of nazareth was passing by
he cried out, jesus, you son of david, have mercy on me!
those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, you son of david, have mercy on me!
standing still, jesus commanded him to be brought to him
when he had come near, he asked him,
what do you want me to do? he said, lord, that i may see again
jesus said to him, receive your sight
your faith has healed you
immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying god
all the people, when they saw it, praised god
he entered and was passing through jericho
there was a man named zacchaeus
he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich
he was trying to see who jesus was, and couldnt because of the crowd, because he was short
he ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way
when jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today i must stay at your house
he hurried, came down, and received him joyfully
when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, he has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner
zacchaeus stood and said to the lord, behold, lord, half of my goods i give to the poor
if i have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, i restore four times as much
jesus said to him, today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of abraham
for the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost
as they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of god would be revealed immediately
he said therefore, a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return
he called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, conduct business until i come
but his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, we dont want this man to reign over us
it happened when he had come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business
the first came before him, saying, lord, your mina has made ten more minas
he said to him, well done, you good servant! because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities
the second came, saying, your mina, lord, has made five minas
so he said to him, and you are to be over five cities
another came, saying, lord, behold, your mina, which i kept laid away in a handkerchief,
for i feared you, because you are an exacting man
you take up that which you didnt lay down, and reap that which you didnt sow
he said to him, out of your own mouth will i judge you, you wicked servant! you knew that i am an exacting man, taking up that which i didnt lay down, and reaping that which i didnt sow
then why didnt you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, i might have earned interest on it?
he said to those who stood by, take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas
they said to him, lord, he has ten minas!
for i tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesnt have, even that which he has will be taken away from him
but bring those enemies of mine who didnt want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me
having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to jerusalem
it happened, when he drew near to bethsphage and bethany, at the mountain that is called olivet, he sent two of his disciples,
saying, go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat
untie it, and bring it
if anyone asks you, why are you untying it? say to him
the lord needs it
those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them
as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, why are you untying the colt?
they said, the lord needs it
they brought it to jesus
they threw their cloaks on the colt, and set jesus on them
as he went, they spread their cloaks in the way
as he was now getting near, at the descent of the mount of olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
saying, blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lord! peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!
some of the pharisees from the multitude said to him, teacher, rebuke your disciples!
he answered them, i tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out
when he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it,
saying, if you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! but now, they are hidden from your eyes
for the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,
and will dash you and your children within you to the ground
they will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didnt know the time of your visitation
he entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
saying to them, it is written, my house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers!
he was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him
they couldnt find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said
it happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the good news, that the priests and scribes came to him with the elders
they asked him, tell us
by what authority do you do these things? or who is giving you this authority?
he answered them, i also will ask you one question
tell me
the baptism of john, was it from heaven, or from men?
they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we say, from heaven, he will say, why didnt you believe him?
but if we say, from men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that john was a prophet
they answered that they didnt know where it was from
jesus said to them, neither will i tell you by what authority i do these things
he began to tell the people this parable
a man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time
at the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard
but the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty
he sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty
he sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out
the lord of the vineyard said, what shall i do? i will send my beloved son
it may be that seeing him, they will respect him
but when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, this is the heir
come, lets kill him, that the inheritance may be ours
they threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him
what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
he will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others
when they heard it, they said, may it never be!
but he looked at them, and said, then what is this that is written, the stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone?
everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust
the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people--for they knew he had spoken this parable against them
they watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor
they asked him, teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and arent partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of god
is it lawful for us to pay taxes to caesar, or not?
but he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, why do you test me?
show me a denarius
whose image and inscription are on it? they answered, caesars
he said to them, then give to caesar the things that are caesars, and to god the things that are gods
they werent able to trap him in his words before the people
they marveled at his answer, and were silent
some of the sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection
they asked him, teacher, moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother
there were therefore seven brothers
the first took a wife, and died childless
the second took her as wife, and he died childless
the third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died
afterward the woman also died
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? for the seven had her as a wife
jesus said to them, the children of this age marry, and are given in marriage
but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage
for they cant die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of god, being children of the resurrection
but that the dead are raised, even moses showed at the bush, when he called the lord the god of abraham, the god of isaac, and the god of jacob
now he is not the god of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him
some of the scribes answered, teacher, you speak well
they didnt dare to ask him any more questions
he said to them, why do they say that the christ is davids son?
david himself says in the book of psalms, the lord said to my lord, sit at my right hand,
until i make your enemies the footstool of your feet
david therefore calls him lord, so how is he his son?
in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;
who devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers
these will receive greater condemnation
he looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury
he saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins
he said, truly i tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,
for all these put in gifts for god from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on
as some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,
as for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down
they asked him, teacher, so when will these things be? what is the sign that these things are about to happen?
he said, watch out that you dont get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, i am he, and, the time is at hand
therefore dont follow them
when you hear of wars and disturbances, dont be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end wont come immediately
then he said to them, nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
there will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places
there will be terrors and great signs from heaven
but before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my names sake
it will turn out as a testimony for you
settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict
you will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends
they will cause some of you to be put to death
you will be hated by all men for my names sake
and not a hair of your head will perish
by your endurance you will win your lives
but when you see jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand
then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains
let those who are in the midst of her depart
let those who are in the country not enter therein
for these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled
woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! for there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people
they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations
jerusalem will be trampled down by the gentiles, until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled
there will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;
men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world
for the powers of the heavens will be shaken
then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
but when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near
he told them a parable
see the fig tree, and all the trees
when they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near
even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of god is near
most certainly i tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished
heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away
so be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly
for it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth
therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the son of man
every day jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called olivet
all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him
now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the passover, drew near
the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people
satan entered into judas, who was surnamed iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve
he went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them
they were glad, and agreed to give him money
he consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude
the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed
he sent peter and john, saying, go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat
they said to him, where do you want us to prepare?
he said to them, behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you
follow him into the house which he enters
tell the master of the house, the teacher says to you, where is the guest room, where i may eat the passover with my disciples?
he will show you a large, furnished upper room
make preparations there
they went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the passover
when the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles
he said to them, i have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer,
for i tell you, i will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god
he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, take this, and share it among yourselves,
for i tell you, i will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of god comes
he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, this is my body which is given for you
do this in memory of me
likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you
but behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table
the son of man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!
they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing
there arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest
he said to them, the kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors
but not so with you
but one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves
for who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? isnt it he who sits at the table? but i am in the midst of you as one who serves
but you are those who have continued with me in my trials
i confer on you a kingdom, even as my father conferred on me,
that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
you will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of israel
the lord said, simon, simon, behold, satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,
but i prayed for you, that your faith wouldnt fail
you, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers 
he said to him, lord, i am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!
he said, i tell you, peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times
he said to them, when i sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything? they said, nothing
then he said to them, but now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet
whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword
for i tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me
he was counted with transgressors
for that which concerns me has an end
they said, lord, behold, here are two swords
he said to them, that is enough
he came out, and went, as his custom was, to the mount of olives
his disciples also followed him
when he was at the place, he said to them, pray that you dont enter into temptation
he was withdrawn from them about a stones throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
saying, father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me
nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done
an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him
being in agony he prayed more earnestly
his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground
when he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,
and said to them, why do you sleep? rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation
while he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called judas, one of the twelve, was leading them
he came near to jesus to kiss him
but jesus said to him, judas, do you betray the son of man with a kiss?
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, lord, shall we strike with the sword?
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear
but jesus answered, let me at least do this--and he touched his ear, and healed him
jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
when i was with you in the temple daily, you didnt stretch out your hands against me
but this is your hour, and the power of darkness
they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priests house
but peter followed from a distance
when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, peter sat among them
a certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, this man also was with him
he denied jesus, saying, woman, i dont know him
after a little while someone else saw him, and said, you also are one of them! but peter answered, man, i am not!
after about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, truly this man also was with him, for he is a galilean!
but peter said, man, i dont know what you are talking about! immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed
the lord turned, and looked at peter
then peter remembered the lords word, how he said to him, before the rooster crows you will deny me three times
he went out, and wept bitterly
the men who held jesus mocked him and beat him
having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, prophesy! who is the one who struck you?
they spoke many other things against him, insulting him
as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,
if you are the christ, tell us
but he said to them, if i tell you, you wont believe,
and if i ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go
from now on, the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god
they all said, are you then the son of god? he said to them, you say it, because i am
they said, why do we need any more witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!
the whole company of them rose up and brought him before pilate
they began to accuse him, saying, we found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to caesar, and saying that he himself is christ, a king
pilate asked him, are you the king of the jews? he answered him, so you say
pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, i find no basis for a charge against this man
but they insisted, saying, he stirs up the people, teaching throughout all judea, beginning from galilee even to this place
but when pilate heard galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a galilean
when he found out that he was in herods jurisdiction, he sent him to herod, who was also in jerusalem during those days
now when herod saw jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him
he hoped to see some miracle done by him
he questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers
the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him
herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him
dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to pilate
herod and pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other
pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
and said to them, you brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, i have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him
neither has herod, for i sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him
i will therefore chastise him and release him
now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast
but they all cried out together, saying, away with this man! release to us barabbas!--
one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder
then pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release jesus,
but they shouted, saying, crucify! crucify him!
he said to them the third time, why? what evil has this man done? i have found no capital crime in him
i will therefore chastise him and release him
but they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified
their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed
pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done
he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered jesus up to their will
when they led him away, they grabbed one simon of cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after jesus
a great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him
but jesus, turning to them, said, daughters of jerusalem, dont weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children
for behold, the days are coming in which they will say, blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed
then they will begin to tell the mountains, fall on us! and tell the hills, cover us
for if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?
there were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death
when they came to the place that is called the skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left
jesus said, father, forgive them, for they dont know what they are doing
dividing his garments among them, they cast lots
the people stood watching
the rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, he saved others
let him save himself, if this is the christ of god, his chosen one!
the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
and saying, if you are the king of the jews, save yourself!
an inscription was also written over him in letters of greek, latin, and hebrew
this is the king of the jews
one of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, if you are the christ, save yourself and us!
but the other answered, and rebuking him said, dont you even fear god, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
and we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong
he said to jesus, lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom
jesus said to him, assuredly i tell you, today you will be with me in paradise
it was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour
the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two
jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, father, into your hands i commit my spirit! having said this, he breathed his last
when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified god, saying, certainly this was a righteous man
all the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts
all his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things
behold, a man named joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man
, from arimathaea, a city of the jews, who was also waiting for the kingdom of god
this man went to pilate, and asked for jesus body
he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid
it was the day of the preparation, and the sabbath was drawing near
the women, who had come with him out of galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid
they returned, and prepared spices and ointments
on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment
but on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared
they found the stone rolled away from the tomb
they entered in, and didnt find the lord jesus body
it happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing
becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth
they said to them, why do you seek the living among the dead?
he isnt here, but is risen
remember what he told you when he was still in galilee,
saying that the son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?
they remembered his words,
returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest
now they were mary magdalene, joanna, and mary the mother of james
the other women with them told these things to the apostles
these words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didnt believe them
but peter got up and ran to the tomb
stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened
behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named emmaus, which was sixty stadia from jerusalem
they talked with each other about all of these things which had happened
it happened, while they talked and questioned together, that jesus himself came near, and went with them
but their eyes were kept from recognizing him
he said to them, what are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?
one of them, named cleopas, answered him, are you the only stranger in jerusalem who doesnt know the things which have happened there in these days?
he said to them, what things? they said to him, the things concerning jesus, the nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people;
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him
but we were hoping that it was he who would redeem israel
yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened
also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;
and when they didnt find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive
some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didnt see him
he said to them, foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
didnt the christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?
beginning from moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
they drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further
they urged him, saying, stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over
he went in to stay with them
it happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks
breaking it, he gave to them
their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight
they said one to another, werent our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the scriptures to us?
they rose up that very hour, returned to jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
saying, the lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to simon!
they related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread
as they said these things, jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, peace be to you
but they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit
he said to them, why are you troubled? why do doubts arise in your hearts?
see my hands and my feet, that it is truly me
touch me and see, for a spirit doesnt have flesh and bones, as you see that i have
when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet
while they still didnt believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, do you have anything here to eat?
they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb
he took them, and ate in front of them
he said to them, this is what i told you, while i was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled
then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures
he said to them, thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at jerusalem
you are witnesses of these things
behold, i send forth the promise of my father on you
but wait in the city of jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high
he led them out as far as bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them
it happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven
they worshiped him, and returned to jerusalem with great joy,
and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing god
amen
in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god
the same was in the beginning with god
all things were made through him
without him was not anything made that has been made
in him was life, and the life was the light of men
the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasnt overcome it
there came a man, sent from god, whose name was john
the same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him
he was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light
the true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world
he was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didnt recognize him
he came to his own, and those who were his own didnt receive him
but as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become gods children, to those who believe in his name
who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of god
the word became flesh, and lived among us
we saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only son of the father, full of grace and truth
john testified about him
he cried out, saying, this was he of whom i said, he who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me
from his fullness we all received grace upon grace
for the law was given through moses
grace and truth were realized through jesus christ
no one has seen god at any time
the one and only son, who is in the bosom of the father, he has declared him
this is johns testimony, when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him, who are you?
he declared, and didnt deny, but he declared, i am not the christ
they asked him, what then? are you elijah? he said, i am not
are you the prophet? he answered, no
they said therefore to him, who are you? give us an answer to take back to those who sent us
what do you say about yourself?
he said, i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the lord, as isaiah the prophet said
the ones who had been sent were from the pharisees
they asked him, why then do you baptize, if you are not the christ, nor elijah, nor the prophet?
john answered them, i baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you dont know
he is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap im not worthy to loosen
these things were done in bethany beyond the jordan, where john was baptizing
the next day, he saw jesus coming to him, and said, behold, the lamb of god, who takes away the sin of the world!
this is he of whom i said, after me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me
i didnt know him, but for this reason i came baptizing in water
that he would be revealed to israel
john testified, saying, i have seen the spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him
i didnt recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, on whomever you will see the spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the holy spirit
i have seen, and have testified that this is the son of god
again, the next day, john was standing with two of his disciples,
and he looked at jesus as he walked, and said, behold, the lamb of god!
the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed jesus
jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, what are you looking for? they said to him, rabbi, where are you staying?
he said to them, come, and see
they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day
it was about the tenth hour
one of the two who heard john, and followed him, was andrew, simon peters brother
he first found his own brother, simon, and said to him, we have found the messiah! 
he brought him to jesus
jesus looked at him, and said, you are simon the son of jonah
you shall be called cephas 
on the next day, he was determined to go out into galilee, and he found philip
jesus said to him, follow me
now philip was from bethsaida, of the city of andrew and peter
philip found nathanael, and said to him, we have found him, of whom moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote
jesus of nazareth, the son of joseph
nathanael said to him, can any good thing come out of nazareth? philip said to him, come and see
jesus saw nathanael coming to him, and said about him, behold, an israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!
nathanael said to him, how do you know me? jesus answered him, before philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, i saw you
nathanael answered him, rabbi, you are the son of god! you are king of israel!
jesus answered him, because i told you, i saw you underneath the fig tree, do you believe? you will see greater things than these!
he said to him, most certainly, i tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of god ascending and descending on the son of man
the third day, there was a marriage in cana of galilee
jesus mother was there
jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage
when the wine ran out, jesus mother said to him, they have no wine
jesus said to her, woman, what does that have to do with you and me? my hour has not yet come
his mother said to the servants, whatever he says to you, do it
now there were six water pots of stone set there after the jews way of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece
jesus said to them, fill the water pots with water
they filled them up to the brim
he said to them, now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast
so they took it
when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didnt know where it came from, the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
and said to him, everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse
you have kept the good wine until now!
this beginning of his signs jesus did in cana of galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him
after this, he went down to capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days
the passover of the jews was at hand, and jesus went up to jerusalem
he found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting
he made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers money, and overthrew their tables
to those who sold the doves, he said, take these things out of here! dont make my fathers house a marketplace!
his disciples remembered that it was written, zeal for your house will eat me up
the jews therefore answered him, what sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?
jesus answered them, destroy this temple, and in three days i will raise it up
the jews therefore said, it took forty-six years to build this temple! will you raise it up in three days?
but he spoke of the temple of his body
when therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture, and the word which jesus had said
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did
but jesus didnt trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,
and because he didnt need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man
now there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus, a ruler of the jews
the same came to him by night, and said to him, rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from god, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless god is with him
jesus answered him, most certainly, i tell you, unless one is born anew, he cant see the kingdom of god
nicodemus said to him, how can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mothers womb, and be born?
jesus answered, most certainly i tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he cant enter into the kingdom of god!
that which is born of the flesh is flesh
that which is born of the spirit is spirit
dont marvel that i said to you, you must be born anew
the wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but dont know where it comes from and where it is going
so is everyone who is born of the spirit
nicodemus answered him, how can these things be?
jesus answered him, are you the teacher of israel, and dont understand these things?
most certainly i tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you dont receive our witness
if i told you earthly things and you dont believe, how will you believe if i tell you heavenly things?
no one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the son of man, who is in heaven
as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up,
that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life
for god so loved the world, that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life
for god didnt send his son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him
he who believes in him is not judged
he who doesnt believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only son of god
this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil
for everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesnt come to the light, lest his works would be exposed
but he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in god
after these things, jesus came with his disciples into the land of judea
he stayed there with them, and baptized
john also was baptizing in enon near salim, because there was much water there
they came, and were baptized
for john was not yet thrown into prison
there arose therefore a questioning on the part of johns disciples with some jews about purification
they came to john, and said to him, rabbi, he who was with you beyond the jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him
john answered, a man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven
you yourselves testify that i said, i am not the christ, but, i have been sent before him
he who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegrooms voice
this, my joy, therefore is made full
he must increase, but i must decrease
he who comes from above is above all
he who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth
he who comes from heaven is above all
what he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness
he who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that god is true
for he whom god has sent speaks the words of god; for god gives the spirit without measure
the father loves the son, and has given all things into his hand
one who believes in the son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the son wont see life, but the wrath of god remains on him
therefore when the lord knew that the pharisees had heard that jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than john
,
he left judea, and departed into galilee
he needed to pass through samaria
so he came to a city of samaria, called sychar, near the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son, joseph
jacobs well was there
jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well
it was about the sixth hour 
a woman of samaria came to draw water
jesus said to her, give me a drink
for his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food
the samaritan woman therefore said to him, how is it that you, being a jew, ask for a drink from me, a samaritan woman? 
jesus answered her, if you knew the gift of god, and who it is who says to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water
the woman said to him, sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep
from where then have you that living water?
are you greater than our father, jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?
jesus answered her, everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
but whoever drinks of the water that i will give him will never thirst again; but the water that i will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life
the woman said to him, sir, give me this water, so that i dont get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw
jesus said to her, go, call your husband, and come here
the woman answered, i have no husband
jesus said to her, you said well, i have no husband,
for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband
this you have said truly
the woman said to him, sir, i perceive that you are a prophet
our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you jews say that in jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship
jesus said to her, woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in jerusalem, will you worship the father
you worship that which you dont know
we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the jews
but the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and truth, for the father seeks such to be his worshippers
god is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
the woman said to him, i know that messiah comes, 
when he has come, he will declare to us all things
jesus said to her, i am he, the one who speaks to you
at this, his disciples came
they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, what are you looking for? or, why do you speak with her?
so the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,
come, see a man who told me everything that i did
can this be the christ?
they went out of the city, and were coming to him
in the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, rabbi, eat
but he said to them, i have food to eat that you dont know about
the disciples therefore said one to another, has anyone brought him something to eat?
jesus said to them, my food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work
dont you say, there are yet four months until the harvest? behold, i tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already
he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together
for in this the saying is true, one sows, and another reaps
i sent you to reap that for which you havent labored
others have labored, and you have entered into their labor
from that city many of the samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, he told me everything that i did
so when the samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them
he stayed there two days
many more believed because of his word
they said to the woman, now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the christ, the savior of the world
after the two days he went out from there and went into galilee
for jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country
so when he came into galilee, the galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast
jesus came therefore again to cana of galilee, where he made the water into wine
there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum
when he heard that jesus had come out of judea into galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death
jesus therefore said to him, unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe
the nobleman said to him, sir, come down before my child dies
jesus said to him, go your way
your son lives
the man believed the word that jesus spoke to him, and he went his way
as he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying your child lives!
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better
they said therefore to him, yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him
so the father knew that it was at that hour in which jesus said to him, your son lives
he believed, as did his whole house
this is again the second sign that jesus did, having come out of judea into galilee
after these things, there was a feast of the jews, and jesus went up to jerusalem
now in jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in hebrew, bethesda, having five porches
in these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;
for an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water
whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had
a certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years
when jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, do you want to be made well?
the sick man answered him, sir, i have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while im coming, another steps down before me
jesus said to him, arise, take up your mat, and walk
immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked
now it was the sabbath on that day
so the jews said to him who was cured, it is the sabbath
it is not lawful for you to carry the mat
he answered them, he who made me well, the same said to me, take up your mat, and walk
then they asked him, who is the man who said to you, take up your mat, and walk?
but he who was healed didnt know who it was, for jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place
afterward jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, behold, you are made well
sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you
the man went away, and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well
for this cause the jews persecuted jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the sabbath
but jesus answered them, my father is still working, so i am working, too
for this cause therefore the jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but also called god his own father, making himself equal with god
jesus therefore answered them, most certainly, i tell you, the son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the father doing
for whatever things he does, these the son also does likewise
for the father has affection for the son, and shows him all things that he himself does
he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel
for as the father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the son also gives life to whom he desires
for the father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the son,
that all may honor the son, even as they honor the father
he who doesnt honor the son doesnt honor the father who sent him
most certainly i tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesnt come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life
most certainly, i tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the son of gods voice; and those who hear will live
for as the father has life in himself, even so he gave to the son also to have life in himself
he also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man
dont marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment
i can of myself do nothing
as i hear, i judge, and my judgment is righteous; because i dont seek my own will, but the will of my father who sent me
if i testify about myself, my witness is not valid
it is another who testifies about me
i know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true
you have sent to john, and he has testified to the truth
but the testimony which i receive is not from man
however, i say these things that you may be saved
he was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light
but the testimony which i have is greater than that of john, for the works which the father gave me to accomplish, the very works that i do, testify about me, that the father has sent me
the father himself, who sent me, has testified about me
you have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form
you dont have his word living in you; because you dont believe him whom he sent
you search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me
yet you will not come to me, that you may have life
i dont receive glory from men
but i know you, that you dont have gods love in yourselves
i have come in my fathers name, and you dont receive me
if another comes in his own name, you will receive him
how can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you dont seek the glory that comes from the only god?
dont think that i will accuse you to the father
there is one who accuses you, even moses, on whom you have set your hope
for if you believed moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me
but if you dont believe his writings, how will you believe my words?
after these things, jesus went away to the other side of the sea of galilee, which is also called the sea of tiberias
a great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick
jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples
now the passover, the feast of the jews, was at hand
jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to philip, where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?
this he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do
philip answered him, two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little
one of his disciples, andrew, simon peters brother, said to him,
there is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?
jesus said, have the people sit down
now there was much grass in that place
so the men sat down, in number about five thousand
jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired
when they were filled, he said to his disciples, gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost
so they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten
when therefore the people saw the sign which jesus did, they said, this is truly the prophet who comes into the world
jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself
when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to capernaum
it was now dark, and jesus had not come to them
the sea was tossed by a great wind blowing
when therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid
but he said to them, it is i 
dont be afraid
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat
immediately the boat was at the land where they were going
on the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that jesus hadnt entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone
however boats from tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the lord had given thanks
when the multitude therefore saw that jesus wasnt there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to capernaum, seeking jesus
when they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, rabbi, when did you come here?
jesus answered them, most certainly i tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled
dont work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the son of man will give to you
for god the father has sealed him
they said therefore to him, what must we do, that we may work the works of god?
jesus answered them, this is the work of god, that you believe in him whom he has sent
they said therefore to him, what then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? what work do you do?
our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness
as it is written, he gave them bread out of heaven to eat
jesus therefore said to them, most certainly, i tell you, it wasnt moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my father gives you the true bread out of heaven
for the bread of god is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world
they said therefore to him, lord, always give us this bread
jesus said to them, i am the bread of life
he who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty
but i told you that you have seen me, and yet you dont believe
all those whom the father gives me will come to me
he who comes to me i will in no way throw out
for i have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me
this is the will of my father who sent me, that of all he has given to me i should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day
this is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and i will raise him up at the last day
the jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, i am the bread which came down out of heaven
they said, isnt this jesus, the son of joseph, whose father and mother we know? how then does he say, i have come down out of heaven?
therefore jesus answered them, dont murmur among yourselves
no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him, and i will raise him up in the last day
it is written in the prophets, they will all be taught by god
therefore everyone who hears from the father, and has learned, comes to me
not that anyone has seen the father, except he who is from god
he has seen the father
most certainly, i tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life
i am the bread of life
your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died
this is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die
i am the living bread which came down out of heaven
if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever
yes, the bread which i will give for the life of the world is my flesh
the jews therefore contended with one another, saying, how can this man give us his flesh to eat?
jesus therefore said to them, most certainly i tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you dont have life in yourselves
he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and i will raise him up at the last day
for my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed
he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and i in him
as the living father sent me, and i live because of the father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me
this is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate the manna, and died
he who eats this bread will live forever
he said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in capernaum
therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, this is a hard saying! who can listen to it?
but jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, does this cause you to stumble?
then what if you would see the son of man ascending to where he was before?
it is the spirit who gives life
the flesh profits nothing
the words that i speak to you are spirit, and are life
but there are some of you who dont believe
for jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didnt believe, and who it was who would betray him
he said, for this cause have i said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my father
at this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him
jesus said therefore to the twelve, you dont also want to go away, do you?
simon peter answered him, lord, to whom would we go? you have the words of eternal life
we have come to believe and know that you are the christ, the son of the living god
jesus answered them, didnt i choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?
now he spoke of judas, the son of simon iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve
after these things, jesus was walking in galilee, for he wouldnt walk in judea, because the jews sought to kill him
now the feast of the jews, the feast of booths, was at hand
his brothers therefore said to him, depart from here, and go into judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do
for no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly
if you do these things, reveal yourself to the world
for even his brothers didnt believe in him
jesus therefore said to them, my time has not yet come, but your time is always ready
the world cant hate you, but it hates me, because i testify about it, that its works are evil
you go up to the feast
i am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled
having said these things to them, he stayed in galilee
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret
the jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, where is he?
there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him
some said, he is a good man
others said, not so, but he leads the multitude astray
yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the jews
but when it was now the midst of the feast, jesus went up into the temple and taught
the jews therefore marveled, saying, how does this man know letters, having never been educated?
jesus therefore answered them, my teaching is not mine, but his who sent me
if anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from god, or if i am speaking from myself
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him
didnt moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? why do you seek to kill me?
the multitude answered, you have a demon! who seeks to kill you?
jesus answered them, i did one work, and you all marvel because of it
moses has given you circumcision, and on the sabbath you circumcise a boy
if a boy receives circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because i made a man completely healthy on the sabbath?
dont judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment
therefore some of them of jerusalem said, isnt this he whom they seek to kill?
behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him
can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the christ?
however we know where this man comes from, but when the christ comes, no one will know where he comes from
jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, you both know me, and know where i am from
i have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you dont know
i know him, because i am from him, and he sent me
they sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come
but of the multitude, many believed in him
they said, when the christ comes, he wont do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?
the pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the pharisees sent officers to arrest him
then jesus said, i will be with you a little while longer, then i go to him who sent me
you will seek me, and wont find me; and where i am, you cant come
the jews therefore said among themselves, where will this man go that we wont find him? will he go to the dispersion among the greeks, and teach the greeks?
what is this word that he said, you will seek me, and wont find me; and where i am, you cant come?
now on the last and greatest day of the feast, jesus stood and cried out, if anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
he who believes in me, as the scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water
but he said this about the spirit, which those believing in him were to receive
for the holy spirit was not yet given, because jesus wasnt yet glorified
many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, this is truly the prophet
others said, this is the christ
but some said, what, does the christ come out of galilee?
hasnt the scripture said that the christ comes of the seed of david, and from bethlehem, the village where david was?
so there arose a division in the multitude because of him
some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and pharisees, and they said to them, why didnt you bring him?
the officers answered, no man ever spoke like this man!
the pharisees therefore answered them, you arent also led astray, are you?
have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the pharisees?
but this multitude that doesnt know the law is accursed
nicodemus  said to them,
does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?
they answered him, are you also from galilee? search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of galilee
everyone went to his own house,
but jesus went to the mount of olives
now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him
he sat down, and taught them
the scribes and the pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery
having set her in the midst,
they told him, teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act
now in our law, moses commanded us to stone such
what then do you say about her?
they said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of
but jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger
but when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, he who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her
again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground
they, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last
jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle
jesus, standing up, saw her and said, woman, where are your accusers? did no one condemn you?
she said, no one, lord
jesus said, neither do i condemn you
go your way
from now on, sin no more
again, therefore, jesus spoke to them, saying, i am the light of the world
he who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life
the pharisees therefore said to him, you testify about yourself
your testimony is not valid
jesus answered them, even if i testify about myself, my testimony is true, for i know where i came from, and where i am going; but you dont know where i came from, or where i am going
you judge according to the flesh
i judge no one
even if i do judge, my judgment is true, for i am not alone, but i am with the father who sent me
its also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid
i am one who testifies about myself, and the father who sent me testifies about me
they said therefore to him, where is your father? jesus answered, you know neither me, nor my father
if you knew me, you would know my father also
jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple
yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come
jesus said therefore again to them, i am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins
where i go, you cant come
the jews therefore said, will he kill himself, that he says, where i am going, you cant come?
he said to them, you are from beneath
i am from above
you are of this world
i am not of this world
i said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that i am he, you will die in your sins
they said therefore to him, who are you? jesus said to them, just what i have been saying to you from the beginning
i have many things to speak and to judge concerning you
however he who sent me is true; and the things which i heard from him, these i say to the world
they didnt understand that he spoke to them about the father
jesus therefore said to them, when you have lifted up the son of man, then you will know that i am he, and i do nothing of myself, but as my father taught me, i say these things
he who sent me is with me
the father hasnt left me alone, for i always do the things that are pleasing to him
as he spoke these things, many believed in him
jesus therefore said to those jews who had believed him, if you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples
you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free
they answered him, we are abrahams seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone
how do you say, you will be made free?
jesus answered them, most certainly i tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin
a bondservant doesnt live in the house forever
a son remains forever
if therefore the son makes you free, you will be free indeed
i know that you are abrahams seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you
i say the things which i have seen with my father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father
they answered him, our father is abraham
jesus said to them, if you were abrahams children, you would do the works of abraham
but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which i heard from god
abraham didnt do this
you do the works of your father
they said to him, we were not born of sexual immorality
we have one father, god
therefore jesus said to them, if god were your father, you would love me, for i came out and have come from god
for i havent come of myself, but he sent me
why dont you understand my speech? because you cant hear my word
you are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father
he was a murderer from the beginning, and doesnt stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him
when he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father
but because i tell the truth, you dont believe me
which of you convicts me of sin? if i tell the truth, why do you not believe me?
he who is of god hears the words of god
for this cause you dont hear, because you are not of god
then the jews answered him, dont we say well that you are a samaritan, and have a demon?
jesus answered, i dont have a demon, but i honor my father, and you dishonor me
but i dont seek my own glory
there is one who seeks and judges
most certainly, i tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death
then the jews said to him, now we know that you have a demon
abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, if a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death
are you greater than our father, abraham, who died? the prophets died
who do you make yourself out to be?
jesus answered, if i glorify myself, my glory is nothing
it is my father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our god
you have not known him, but i know him
if i said, i dont know him, i would be like you, a liar
but i know him, and keep his word
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day
he saw it, and was glad
the jews therefore said to him, you are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen abraham?
jesus said to them, most certainly, i tell you, before abraham came into existence, i am
therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through their midst, and so passed by
as he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth
his disciples asked him, rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
jesus answered, neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of god might be revealed in him
i must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day
the night is coming, when no one can work
while i am in the world, i am the light of the world
when he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind mans eyes with the mud,
and said to him, go, wash in the pool of siloam 
so he went away, washed, and came back seeing
the neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, isnt this he who sat and begged?
others were saying, it is he
still others were saying, he looks like him
he said, i am he
they therefore were asking him, how were your eyes opened?
he answered, a man called jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, go to the pool of siloam, and wash
so i went away and washed, and i received sight
then they asked him, where is he? he said, i dont know
they brought him who had been blind to the pharisees
it was a sabbath when jesus made the mud and opened his eyes
again therefore the pharisees also asked him how he received his sight
he said to them, he put mud on my eyes, i washed, and i see
some therefore of the pharisees said, this man is not from god, because he doesnt keep the sabbath
others said, how can a man who is a sinner do such signs? there was division among them
therefore they asked the blind man again, what do you say about him, because he opened your eyes? he said, he is a prophet
the jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
and asked them, is this your son, whom you say was born blind? how then does he now see?
his parents answered them, we know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
but how he now sees, we dont know; or who opened his eyes, we dont know
he is of age
ask him
he will speak for himself
his parents said these things because they feared the jews; for the jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as christ, he would be put out of the synagogue
therefore his parents said, he is of age
ask him
so they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, give glory to god
we know that this man is a sinner
he therefore answered, i dont know if he is a sinner
one thing i do know
that though i was blind, now i see
they said to him again, what did he do to you? how did he open your eyes?
he answered them, i told you already, and you didnt listen
why do you want to hear it again? you dont also want to become his disciples, do you?
they insulted him and said, you are his disciple, but we are disciples of moses
we know that god has spoken to moses
but as for this man, we dont know where he comes from
the man answered them, how amazing! you dont know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes
we know that god doesnt listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of god, and does his will, he listens to him
since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind
if this man were not from god, he could do nothing
they answered him, you were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? they threw him out
jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, do you believe in the son of god?
he answered, who is he, lord, that i may believe in him?
jesus said to him, you have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you
he said, lord, i believe! and he worshiped him
jesus said, i came into this world for judgment, that those who dont see may see; and that those who see may become blind
those of the pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, are we also blind?
jesus said to them, if you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, we see
therefore your sin remains
most certainly, i tell you, one who doesnt enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber
but one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
the gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice
he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out
whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice
they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they dont know the voice of strangers
jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didnt understand what he was telling them
jesus therefore said to them again, most certainly, i tell you, i am the sheeps door
all who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didnt listen to them
i am the door
if anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture
the thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy
i came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly
i am the good shepherd
the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
he who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesnt own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees
the wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them
the hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesnt care for the sheep
i am the good shepherd
i know my own, and im known by my own;
even as the father knows me, and i know the father
i lay down my life for the sheep
i have other sheep, which are not of this fold
i must bring them also, and they will hear my voice
they will become one flock with one shepherd
therefore the father loves me, because i lay down my life, that i may take it again
no one takes it away from me, but i lay it down by myself
i have power to lay it down, and i have power to take it again
i received this commandment from my father
therefore a division arose again among the jews because of these words
many of them said, he has a demon, and is insane! why do you listen to him?
others said, these are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon
it isnt possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?
it was the feast of the dedication at jerusalem
it was winter, and jesus was walking in the temple, in solomons porch
the jews therefore came around him and said to him, how long will you hold us in suspense? if you are the christ, tell us plainly
jesus answered them, i told you, and you dont believe
the works that i do in my fathers name, these testify about me
but you dont believe, because you are not of my sheep, as i told you
my sheep hear my voice, and i know them, and they follow me
i give eternal life to them
they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand
my father, who has given them to me, is greater than all
no one is able to snatch them out of my fathers hand
i and the father are one
therefore jews took up stones again to stone him
jesus answered them, i have shown you many good works from my father
for which of those works do you stone me?
the jews answered him, we dont stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy
because you, being a man, make yourself god
jesus answered them, isnt it written in your law, i said, you are gods?
if he called them gods, to whom the word of god came,
do you say of him whom the father sanctified and sent into the world, you blaspheme, because i said, i am the son of god?
if i dont do the works of my father, dont believe me
but if i do them, though you dont believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the father is in me, and i in the father
they sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand
he went away again beyond the jordan into the place where john was baptizing at first, and there he stayed
many came to him
they said, john indeed did no sign, but everything that john said about this man is true
many believed in him there
now a certain man was sick, lazarus from bethany, of the village of mary and her sister, martha
it was that mary who had anointed the lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, lazarus, was sick
the sisters therefore sent to him, saying, lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick
but when jesus heard it, he said, this sickness is not to death, but for the glory of god, that gods son may be glorified by it
now jesus loved martha, and her sister, and lazarus
when therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was
then after this he said to the disciples, lets go into judea again
the disciples told him, rabbi, the jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?
jesus answered, arent there twelve hours of daylight? if a man walks in the day, he doesnt stumble, because he sees the light of this world
but if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isnt in him
he said these things, and after that, he said to them, our friend, lazarus, has fallen asleep, but i am going so that i may awake him out of sleep
the disciples therefore said, lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover
now jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep
so jesus said to them plainly then, lazarus is dead
i am glad for your sakes that i was not there, so that you may believe
nevertheless, lets go to him
thomas therefore, who is called didymus, said to his fellow disciples, lets go also, that we may die with him
so when jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already
now bethany was near jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away
many of the jews had joined the women around martha and mary, to console them concerning their brother
then when martha heard that jesus was coming, she went and met him, but mary stayed in the house
therefore martha said to jesus, lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldnt have died
even now i know that, whatever you ask of god, god will give you
jesus said to her, your brother will rise again
martha said to him, i know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day
jesus said to her, i am the resurrection and the life
he who believes in me will still live, even if he dies
whoever lives and believes in me will never die
do you believe this?
she said to him, yes, lord
i have come to believe that you are the christ, gods son, he who comes into the world
when she had said this, she went away, and called mary, her sister, secretly, saying, the teacher is here, and is calling you
when she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him
now jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where martha met him
then the jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, she is going to the tomb to weep there
therefore when mary came to where jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldnt have died
when jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
and said, where have you laid him? they told him, lord, come and see
jesus wept
the jews therefore said, see how much affection he had for him!
some of them said, couldnt this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?
jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb
now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it
jesus said, take away the stone
martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days
jesus said to her, didnt i tell you that if you believed, you would see gods glory?
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying
jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, father, i thank you that you listened to me
i know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around i said this, that they may believe that you sent me
when he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, lazarus, come out!
he who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth
jesus said to them, free him, and let him go
therefore many of the jews, who came to mary and saw what jesus did, believed in him
but some of them went away to the pharisees, and told them the things which jesus had done
the chief priests therefore and the pharisees gathered a council, and said, what are we doing? for this man does many signs
if we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation
but a certain one of them, caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, you know nothing at all,
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish
now he didnt say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that jesus would die for the nation,
and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of god who are scattered abroad
so from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death
jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called ephraim
he stayed there with his disciples
now the passover of the jews was at hand
many went up from the country to jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves
then they sought for jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, what do you think--that he isnt coming to the feast at all?
now the chief priests and the pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him
then six days before the passover, jesus came to bethany, where lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead
so they made him a supper there
martha served, but lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him
mary, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair
the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment
then judas iscariot, simons son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,
why wasnt this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it
but jesus said, leave her alone
she has kept this for the day of my burial
for you always have the poor with you, but you dont always have me
a large crowd therefore of the jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for jesus sake only, but that they might see lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead
but the chief priests conspired to put lazarus to death also,
because on account of him many of the jews went away and believed in jesus
on the next day a great multitude had come to the feast
when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem,
they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, hosanna ! blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord, the king of israel!
jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it
as it is written,
dont be afraid, daughter of zion
behold, your king comes, sitting on a donkeys colt
his disciples didnt understand these things at first, but when jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it
for this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign
the pharisees therefore said among themselves, see how you accomplish nothing
behold, the world has gone after him
now there were certain greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast
these, therefore, came to philip, who was from bethsaida of galilee, and asked him, saying, sir, we want to see jesus
philip came and told andrew, and in turn, andrew came with philip, and they told jesus
jesus answered them, the time has come for the son of man to be glorified
most certainly i tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone
but if it dies, it bears much fruit
he who loves his life will lose it
he who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life
if anyone serves me, let him follow me
where i am, there will my servant also be
if anyone serves me, the father will honor him
now my soul is troubled
what shall i say? father, save me from this time? but for this cause i came to this time
father, glorify your name! then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, i have both glorified it, and will glorify it again
the multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered
others said, an angel has spoken to him
jesus answered, this voice hasnt come for my sake, but for your sakes
now is the judgment of this world
now the prince of this world will be cast out
and i, if i am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself
but he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die
the multitude answered him, we have heard out of the law that the christ remains forever
how do you say, the son of man must be lifted up? who is this son of man?
jesus therefore said to them, yet a little while the light is with you
walk while you have the light, that darkness doesnt overtake you
he who walks in the darkness doesnt know where he is going
while you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light
jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them
but though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didnt believe in him,
that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, lord, who has believed our report? to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed?
for this cause they couldnt believe, for isaiah said again,
he has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and i would heal them
isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him
nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the pharisees they didnt confess it, so that they wouldnt be put out of the synagogue,
for they loved mens praise more than gods praise
jesus cried out and said, whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me
he who sees me sees him who sent me
i have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness
if anyone listens to my sayings, and doesnt believe, i dont judge him
for i came not to judge the world, but to save the world
he who rejects me, and doesnt receive my sayings, has one who judges him
the word that i spoke, the same will judge him in the last day
for i spoke not from myself, but the father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what i should say, and what i should speak
i know that his commandment is eternal life
the things therefore which i speak, even as the father has said to me, so i speak
now before the feast of the passover, jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end
during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of judas iscariot, simons son, to betray him,
jesus, knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from god, and was going to god,
arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments
he took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist
then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him
then he came to simon peter
he said to him, lord, do you wash my feet?
jesus answered him, you dont know what i am doing now, but you will understand later
peter said to him, you will never wash my feet! jesus answered him, if i dont wash you, you have no part with me
simon peter said to him, lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!
jesus said to him, someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean
you are clean, but not all of you
for he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, you are not all clean
so when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, do you know what i have done to you?
you call me, teacher and lord
you say so correctly, for so i am
if i then, the lord and the teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anothers feet
for i have given you an example, that you also should do as i have done to you
most certainly i tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him
if you know these things, blessed are you if you do them
i dont speak concerning all of you
i know whom i have chosen
but that the scripture may be fulfilled, he who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me
from now on, i tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that i am he
most certainly i tell you, he who receives whomever i send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me
when jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, most certainly i tell you that one of you will betray me
the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke
one of his disciples, whom jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against jesus breast
simon peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, tell us who it is of whom he speaks
he, leaning back, as he was, on jesus breast, asked him, lord, who is it?
jesus therefore answered, it is he to whom i will give this piece of bread when i have dipped it
so when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to judas, the son of simon iscariot
after the piece of bread, then satan entered into him
then jesus said to him, what you do, do quickly
now no man at the table knew why he said this to him
for some thought, because judas had the money box, that jesus said to him, buy what things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor
therefore having received that morsel, he went out immediately
it was night
when he had gone out, jesus said, now the son of man has been glorified, and god has been glorified in him
if god has been glorified in him, god will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately
little children, i will be with you a little while longer
you will seek me, and as i said to the jews, where i am going, you cant come, so now i tell you
a new commandment i give to you, that you love one another, just like i have loved you; that you also love one another
by this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another
simon peter said to him, lord, where are you going? jesus answered, where i am going, you cant follow now, but you will follow afterwards
peter said to him, lord, why cant i follow you now? i will lay down my life for you
jesus answered him, will you lay down your life for me? most certainly i tell you, the rooster wont crow until you have denied me three times
dont let your heart be troubled
believe in god
believe also in me
in my fathers house are many homes
if it werent so, i would have told you
i am going to prepare a place for you
if i go and prepare a place for you, i will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where i am, you may be there also
where i go, you know, and you know the way
thomas said to him, lord, we dont know where you are going
how can we know the way?
jesus said to him, i am the way, the truth, and the life
no one comes to the father, except through me
if you had known me, you would have known my father also
from now on, you know him, and have seen him
philip said to him, lord, show us the father, and that will be enough for us
jesus said to him, have i been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, philip? he who has seen me has seen the father
how do you say, show us the father?
dont you believe that i am in the father, and the father in me? the words that i tell you, i speak not from myself; but the father who lives in me does his works
believe me that i am in the father, and the father in me; or else believe me for the very works sake
most certainly i tell you, he who believes in me, the works that i do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because i am going to my father
whatever you will ask in my name, that will i do, that the father may be glorified in the son
if you will ask anything in my name, i will do it
if you love me, keep my commandments
i will pray to the father, and he will give you another counselor, that he may be with you forever,--
the spirit of truth, whom the world cant receive; for it doesnt see him, neither knows him
you know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you
i will not leave you orphans
i will come to you
yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me
because i live, you will live also
in that day you will know that i am in my father, and you in me, and i in you
one who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me
one who loves me will be loved by my father, and i will love him, and will reveal myself to him
judas  said to him, lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?
jesus answered him, if a man loves me, he will keep my word
my father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him
he who doesnt love me doesnt keep my words
the word which you hear isnt mine, but the fathers who sent me
i have said these things to you, while still living with you
but the counselor, the holy spirit, whom the father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that i said to you
peace i leave with you
my peace i give to you; not as the world gives, give i to you
dont let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful
you heard how i told you, i go away, and i come to you
if you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because i said i am going to my father; for the father is greater than i
now i have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe
i will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me
but that the world may know that i love the father, and as the father commanded me, even so i do
arise, let us go from here
i am the true vine, and my father is the farmer
every branch in me that doesnt bear fruit, he takes away
every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit
you are already pruned clean because of the word which i have spoken to you
remain in me, and i in you
as the branch cant bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me
i am the vine
you are the branches
he who remains in me, and i in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing
if a man doesnt remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned
if you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you
in this is my father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples
even as the father has loved me, i also have loved you
remain in my love
if you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as i have kept my fathers commandments, and remain in his love
i have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full
this is my commandment, that you love one another, even as i have loved you
greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends
you are my friends, if you do whatever i command you
no longer do i call you servants, for the servant doesnt know what his lord does
but i have called you friends, for everything that i heard from my father, i have made known to you
you didnt choose me, but i chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the father in my name, he may give it to you
i command these things to you, that you may love one another
if the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you
if you were of the world, the world would love its own
but because you are not of the world, since i chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you
remember the word that i said to you
a servant is not greater than his lord
if they persecuted me, they will also persecute you
if they kept my word, they will keep yours also
but all these things will they do to you for my names sake, because they dont know him who sent me
if i had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin
he who hates me, hates my father also
if i hadnt done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldnt have had sin
but now have they seen and also hated both me and my father
but this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, they hated me without a cause
when the counselor has come, whom i will send to you from the father, the spirit of truth, who proceeds from the father, he will testify about me
you will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning
these things have i spoken to you, so that you wouldnt be caused to stumble
they will put you out of the synagogues
yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to god
they will do these things because they have not known the father, nor me
but i have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that i told you about them
i didnt tell you these things from the beginning, because i was with you
but now i am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, where are you going?
but because i have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart
nevertheless i tell you the truth
it is to your advantage that i go away, for if i dont go away, the counselor wont come to you
but if i go, i will send him to you
when he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;
about sin, because they dont believe in me;
about righteousness, because i am going to my father, and you wont see me any more;
about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged
i have yet many things to tell you, but you cant bear them now
however when he, the spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak
he will declare to you things that are coming
he will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you
all things whatever the father has are mine; therefore i said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you
a little while, and you will not see me
again a little while, and you will see me
some of his disciples therefore said to one another, what is this that he says to us, a little while, and you wont see me, and again a little while, and you will see me; and, because i go to the father?
they said therefore, what is this that he says, a little while? we dont know what he is saying
therefore jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that i said, a little while, and you wont see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?
most certainly i tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice
you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy
a woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come
but when she has delivered the child, she doesnt remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world
therefore you now have sorrow, but i will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you
in that day you will ask me no questions
most certainly i tell you, whatever you may ask of the father in my name, he will give it to you
until now, you have asked nothing in my name
ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full
i have spoken these things to you in figures of speech
but the time is coming when i will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the father
in that day you will ask in my name; and i dont say to you, that i will pray to the father for you,
for the father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that i came forth from god
i came out from the father, and have come into the world
again, i leave the world, and go to the father
his disciples said to him, behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech
now we know that you know all things, and dont need for anyone to question you
by this we believe that you came forth from god
jesus answered them, do you now believe?
behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone
yet i am not alone, because the father is with me
i have told you these things, that in me you may have peace
in the world you have oppression; but cheer up! i have overcome the world
jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, father, the time has come
glorify your son, that your son may also glorify you;
even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him
this is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true god, and him whom you sent, jesus christ
i glorified you on the earth
i have accomplished the work which you have given me to do
now, father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which i had with you before the world existed
i revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world
they were yours, and you have given them to me
they have kept your word
now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,
for the words which you have given me i have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that i came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me
i pray for them
i dont pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours
all things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and i am glorified in them
i am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and i am coming to you
holy father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are
while i was with them in the world, i kept them in your name
those whom you have given me i have kept
none of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the scripture might be fulfilled
but now i come to you, and i say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves
i have given them your word
the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as i am not of the world
i pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one
they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
sanctify them in your truth
your word is truth
as you sent me into the world, even so i have sent them into the world
for their sakes i sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth
not for these only do i pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,
that they may all be one; even as you, father, are in me, and i in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me
the glory which you have given me, i have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
i in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me
father, i desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where i am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world
righteous father, the world hasnt known you, but i knew you; and these knew that you sent me
i made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and i in them
when jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook kidron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered
now judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for jesus often met there with his disciples
judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons
jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, who are you looking for?
they answered him, jesus of nazareth
jesus said to them, i am he
judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them
when therefore he said to them, i am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground
again therefore he asked them, who are you looking for? they said, jesus of nazareth
jesus answered, i told you that i am he
if therefore you seek me, let these go their way,
that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, of those whom you have given me, i have lost none
simon peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear
the servants name was malchus
jesus therefore said to peter, put the sword into its sheath
the cup which the father has given me, shall i not surely drink it?
so the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the jews, seized jesus and bound him,
and led him to annas first, for he was father-in-law to caiaphas, who was high priest that year
now it was caiaphas who advised the jews that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people
simon peter followed jesus, as did another disciple
now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with jesus into the court of the high priest;
but peter was standing at the door outside
so the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in peter
then the maid who kept the door said to peter, are you also one of this mans disciples? he said, i am not
now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold
they were warming themselves
peter was with them, standing and warming himself
the high priest therefore asked jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching
jesus answered him, i spoke openly to the world
i always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the jews always meet
i said nothing in secret
why do you ask me? ask those who have heard me what i said to them
behold, these know the things which i said
when he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped jesus with his hand, saying, do you answer the high priest like that?
jesus answered him, if i have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?
annas sent him bound to caiaphas, the high priest
now simon peter was standing and warming himself
they said therefore to him, you arent also one of his disciples, are you? he denied it, and said, i am not
one of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear peter had cut off, said, didnt i see you in the garden with him?
peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed
they led jesus therefore from caiaphas into the praetorium
it was early, and they themselves didnt enter into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover
pilate therefore went out to them, and said, what accusation do you bring against this man?
they answered him, if this man werent an evildoer, we wouldnt have delivered him up to you
pilate therefore said to them, take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law
therefore the jews said to him, it is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,
that the word of jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die
pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium, called jesus, and said to him, are you the king of the jews?
jesus answered him, do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?
pilate answered, im not a jew, am i? your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me
what have you done?
jesus answered, my kingdom is not of this world
if my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that i wouldnt be delivered to the jews
but now my kingdom is not from here
pilate therefore said to him, are you a king then? jesus answered, you say that i am a king
for this reason i have been born, and for this reason i have come into the world, that i should testify to the truth
everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice
pilate said to him, what is truth? when he had said this, he went out again to the jews, and said to them, i find no basis for a charge against him
but you have a custom, that i should release someone to you at the passover
therefore do you want me to release to you the king of the jews?
then they all shouted again, saying, not this man, but barabbas! now barabbas was a robber
so pilate then took jesus, and flogged him
the soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment
they kept saying, hail, king of the jews! and they kept slapping him
then pilate went out again, and said to them, behold, i bring him out to you, that you may know that i find no basis for a charge against him
jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment
pilate said to them, behold, the man!
when therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, crucify! crucify! pilate said to them, take him yourselves, and crucify him, for i find no basis for a charge against him
the jews answered him, we have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the son of god
when therefore pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid
he entered into the praetorium again, and said to jesus, where are you from? but jesus gave him no answer
pilate therefore said to him, arent you speaking to me? dont you know that i have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?
jesus answered, you would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above
therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin
at this, pilate was seeking to release him, but the jews cried out, saying, if you release this man, you arent caesars friend! everyone who makes himself a king speaks against caesar!
when pilate therefore heard these words, he brought jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the pavement, but in hebrew, gabbatha
now it was the preparation day of the passover, at about the sixth hour
he said to the jews, behold, your king!
they cried out, away with him! away with him! crucify him! pilate said to them, shall i crucify your king? the chief priests answered, we have no king but caesar!
so then he delivered him to them to be crucified
so they took jesus and led him away
he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in hebrew, golgotha,
where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and jesus in the middle
pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross
there was written, jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews
therefore many of the jews read this title, for the place where jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in hebrew, in latin, and in greek
the chief priests of the jews therefore said to pilate, dont write, the king of the jews, but, he said, i am king of the jews
pilate answered, what i have written, i have written
then the soldiers, when they had crucified jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat
now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout
then they said to one another, lets not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be, that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, they parted my garments among them
for my cloak they cast lots
therefore the soldiers did these things
but there were standing by the cross of jesus his mother, and his mothers sister, mary the wife of clopas, and mary magdalene
therefore when jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, woman, behold your son!
then he said to the disciple, behold, your mother! from that hour, the disciple took her to his own home
after this, jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, i am thirsty
now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, it is finished
he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit
therefore the jews, because it was the preparation day, so that the bodies wouldnt remain on the cross on the sabbath, asked of pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away
therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;
but when they came to jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didnt break his legs
however one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out
he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true
he knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe
for these things happened, that the scripture might be fulfilled, a bone of him will not be broken
again another scripture says, they will look on him whom they pierced
after these things, joseph of arimathaea, being a disciple of jesus, but secretly for fear of the jews, asked of pilate that he might take away jesus body
pilate gave him permission
he came therefore and took away his body
nicodemus, who at first came to jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred roman pounds
so they took jesus body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the jews is to bury
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden
in the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid
then because of the jews preparation day  they laid jesus there
now on the first day of the week, mary magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb
therefore she ran and came to simon peter, and to the other disciple whom jesus loved, and said to them, they have taken away the lord out of the tomb, and we dont know where they have laid him!
therefore peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb
they both ran together
the other disciple outran peter, and came to the tomb first
stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didnt enter in
then simon peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb
he saw the linen cloths lying,
and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself
so then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed
for as yet they didnt know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead
so the disciples went away again to their own homes
but mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping
so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of jesus had lain
they told her, woman, why are you weeping? she said to them, because they have taken away my lord, and i dont know where they have laid him
when she had said this, she turned around and saw jesus standing, and didnt know that it was jesus
jesus said to her, woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? she, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and i will take him away
jesus said to her, mary
she turned and said to him, rabboni ! which is to say, teacher !
jesus said to her, dont hold me, for i havent yet ascended to my father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, i am ascending to my father and your father, to my god and your god
mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord, and that he had said these things to her
when therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the jews, jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, peace be to you
when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side
the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the lord
jesus therefore said to them again, peace be to you
as the father has sent me, even so i send you
when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, receive the holy spirit!
if you forgive anyones sins, they have been forgiven them
if you retain anyones sins, they have been retained
but thomas, one of the twelve, called didymus, wasnt with them when jesus came
the other disciples therefore said to him, we have seen the lord! but he said to them, unless i see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, i will not believe
after eight days again his disciples were inside, and thomas was with them
jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, peace be to you
then he said to thomas, reach here your finger, and see my hands
reach here your hand, and put it into my side
dont be unbelieving, but believing
thomas answered him, my lord and my god!
jesus said to him, because you have seen me, you have believed
blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed
therefore jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
but these are written, that you may believe that jesus is the christ, the son of god, and that believing you may have life in his name
after these things, jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias
he revealed himself this way
simon peter, thomas called didymus, nathanael of cana in galilee, and the sons of zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together
simon peter said to them, im going fishing
they told him, we are also coming with you
they immediately went out, and entered into the boat
that night, they caught nothing
but when day had already come, jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didnt know that it was jesus
jesus therefore said to them, children, have you anything to eat? they answered him, no
he said to them, cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some
they cast it therefore, and now they werent able to draw it in for the multitude of fish
that disciple therefore whom jesus loved said to peter, its the lord! so when simon peter heard that it was the lord, he wrapped his coat around him, and threw himself into the sea
but the other disciples came in the little boat, dragging the net full of fish
so when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread
jesus said to them, bring some of the fish which you have just caught
simon peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasnt torn
jesus said to them, come and eat breakfast
none of the disciples dared inquire of him, who are you? knowing that it was the lord
then jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise
this is now the third time that jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead
so when they had eaten their breakfast, jesus said to simon peter, simon, son of jonah, do you love me more than these? he said to him, yes, lord; you know that i have affection for you
he said to him, feed my lambs
he said to him again a second time, simon, son of jonah, do you love me? he said to him, yes, lord; you know that i have affection for you
he said to him, tend my sheep
he said to him the third time, simon, son of jonah, do you have affection for me? peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, do you have affection for me? he said to him, lord, you know everything
you know that i have affection for you
jesus said to him, feed my sheep
most certainly i tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to
but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you dont want to go
now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify god
when he had said this, he said to him, follow me
then peter, turning around, saw a disciple following
this was the disciple whom jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on jesus breast at the supper and asked, lord, who is going to betray you?
peter seeing him, said to jesus, lord, what about this man?
jesus said to him, if i desire that he stay until i come, what is that to you? you follow me
this saying therefore went out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldnt die
yet jesus didnt say to him that he wouldnt die, but, if i desire that he stay until i come, what is that to you?
this is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things
we know that his witness is true
there are also many other things which jesus did, which if they would all be written, i suppose that even the world itself wouldnt have room for the books that would be written
the first book i wrote, theophilus, concerned all that jesus began both to do and to teach,
until the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the holy spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen
to these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about gods kingdom
being assembled together with them, he commanded them, dont depart from jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father, which you heard from me
for john indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the holy spirit not many days from now
therefore when they had come together, they asked him, lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to israel?
he said to them, it isnt for you to know times or seasons which the father has set within his own authority
but you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you
you will be witnesses to me in jerusalem, in all judea and samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth
when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight
while they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,
who also said, you men of galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? this jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky
then they returned to jerusalem from the mountain called olivet, which is near jerusalem, a sabbath days journey away
when they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is peter, john, james, andrew, philip, thomas, bartholomew, matthew, james the son of alphaeus, simon the zealot, and judas the son of james
all these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women, and mary the mother of jesus, and with his brothers
in these days, peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said,
brothers, it was necessary that this scripture should be fulfilled, which the holy spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas, who was guide to those who took jesus
for he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry
now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out
it became known to everyone who lived in jerusalem that in their language that field was called akeldama, that is, the field of blood
for it is written in the book of psalms, let his habitation be made desolate
let no one dwell therein; and, let another take his office
of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us,
beginning from the baptism of john, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection
they put forward two, joseph called barsabbas, who was surnamed justus, and matthias
they prayed, and said, you, lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen
to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which judas fell away, that he might go to his own place
they drew lots for them, and the lot fell on matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
now when the day of pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place
suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting
tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them
they were all filled with the holy spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the spirit gave them the ability to speak
now there were dwelling in jerusalem jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky
when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language
they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, behold, arent all these who speak galileans?
how do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
parthians, medes, elamites, and people from mesopotamia, judea, cappadocia, pontus, asia,
phrygia, pamphylia, egypt, the parts of libya around cyrene, visitors from rome, both jews and proselytes,
cretans and arabians
we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of god!
they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, what does this mean?
others, mocking, said, they are filled with new wine
but peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, you men of judea, and all you who dwell at jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words
for these arent drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day 
but this is what has been spoken through the prophet joel
it will be in the last days, says god, that i will pour out my spirit on all flesh
your sons and your daughters will prophesy
your young men will see visions
your old men will dream dreams
yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days, i will pour out my spirit, and they will prophesy
i will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and billows of smoke
the sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the lord comes
it will be, that whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved
men of israel, hear these words! jesus of nazareth, a man approved by god to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,
him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of god, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;
whom god raised up, having freed him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it
for david says concerning him, i saw the lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that i should not be moved
therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced
moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
because you will not leave my soul in hades, neither will you allow your holy one to see decay
you made known to me the ways of life
you will make me full of gladness with your presence
brothers, i may tell you freely of the patriarch david, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day
therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the christ to sit on his throne,
he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the christ, that neither was his soul left in hades, nor did his flesh see decay
this jesus god raised up, to which we all are witnesses
being therefore exalted by the right hand of god, and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear
for david didnt ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, the lord said to my lord, sit by my right hand,
until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet
let all the house of israel therefore know certainly that god has made him both lord and christ, this jesus whom you crucified
now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to peter and the rest of the apostles, brothers, what shall we do?
peter said to them, repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
for the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the lord our god will call to himself
with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, save yourselves from this crooked generation!
then those who gladly received his word were baptized
there were added that day about three thousand souls
they continued steadfastly in the apostles teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer
fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles
all who believed were together, and had all things in common
they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need
day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
praising god, and having favor with all the people
the lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved
peter and john were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour 
a certain man who was lame from his mothers womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple
seeing peter and john about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy
peter, fastening his eyes on him, with john, said, look at us
he listened to them, expecting to receive something from them
but peter said, silver and gold have i none, but what i have, that i give you
in the name of jesus christ of nazareth, get up and walk!
he took him by the right hand, and raised him up
immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength
leaping up, he stood, and began to walk
he entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising god
all the people saw him walking and praising god
they recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the beautiful gate of the temple
they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him
as the lame man who was healed held on to peter and john, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called solomons, greatly wondering
when peter saw it, he responded to the people, you men of israel, why do you marvel at this man? why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?
the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob, the god of our fathers, has glorified his servant jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of pilate, when he had determined to release him
but you denied the holy and righteous one, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
and killed the prince of life, whom god raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses
by faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know
yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all
now, brothers, i know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers
but the things which god announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled
repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the lord,
and that he may send christ jesus, who was ordained for you before,
whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which god spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets
for moses indeed said to the fathers, the lord god will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me
you shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you
it will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people
yes, and all the prophets from samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days
you are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which god made with our fathers, saying to abraham, in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed
god, having raised up his servant, jesus, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness
as they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came to them,
being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in jesus the resurrection from the dead
they laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening
but many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand
it happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in jerusalem
annas the high priest was there, with caiaphas, john, alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest
when they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, by what power, or in what name, have you done this?
then peter, filled with the holy spirit, said to them, you rulers of the people, and elders of israel,
if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,
be it known to you all, and to all the people of israel, that in the name of jesus christ of nazareth, whom you crucified, whom god raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole
he is the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner
there is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved!
now when they saw the boldness of peter and john, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled
they recognized that they had been with jesus
seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
saying, what shall we do to these men? because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in jerusalem, and we cant deny it
but so that this spreads no further among the people, lets threaten them, that from now on they dont speak to anyone in this name
they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus
but peter and john answered them, whether it is right in the sight of god to listen to you rather than to god, judge for yourselves,
for we cant help telling the things which we saw and heard
when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified god for that which was done
for the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old
being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them
when they heard it, they lifted up their voice to god with one accord, and said, o lord, you are god, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
who by the mouth of your servant, david, said, why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
the kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against the lord, and against his christ 
for truly, in this city against your holy servant, jesus, whom you anointed, both herod and pontius pilate, with the gentiles and the people of israel, were gathered together
to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen
now, lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant jesus
when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together
they were all filled with the holy spirit, and they spoke the word of god with boldness
the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul
not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common
with great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the lord jesus
great grace was on them all
for neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,
and laid them at the apostles feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need
joses, who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas, a levite, a man of cyprus by race,
having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
but a certain man named ananias, with sapphira, his wife, sold a possession,
and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles feet
but peter said, ananias, why has satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
while you kept it, didnt it remain your own? after it was sold, wasnt it in your power? how is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? you havent lied to men, but to god
ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died
great fear came on all who heard these things
the young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him
about three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in
peter answered her, tell me whether you sold the land for so much
she said, yes, for so much
but peter asked her, how is it that you have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord? behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out
she fell down immediately at his feet, and died
the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband
great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who heard these things
by the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people
they were all with one accord in solomons porch
none of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them
more believers were added to the lord, multitudes of both men and women
they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them
multitudes also came together from the cities around jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits
and they were all healed
but the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him, and they were filled with jealousy,
and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody
but an angel of the lord opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,
go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life
when they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught
but the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought
but the officers who came didnt find them in the prison
they returned and reported,
we found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!
now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this
one came and told them, behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people
then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them
when they had brought them, they set them before the council
the high priest questioned them,
saying, didnt we strictly command you not to teach in this name? behold, you have filled jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this mans blood on us
but peter and the apostles answered, we must obey god rather than men
the god of our fathers raised up jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree
god exalted him with his right hand to be a prince and a savior, to give repentance to israel, and remission of sins
we are his witnesses of these things; and so also is the holy spirit, whom god has given to those who obey him
but they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them
but one stood up in the council, a pharisee named gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while
he said to them, you men of israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do
for before these days theudas rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves
who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing
after this man, judas of galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him
he also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad
now i tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone
for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown
but if it is of god, you will not be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against god!
they agreed with him
summoning the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of jesus, and let them go
they therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for jesus name
every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and preaching jesus, the christ
now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the hellenists against the hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service
the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, it is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of god and serve tables
therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the holy spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business
but we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word
these words pleased the whole multitude
they chose stephen, a man full of faith and of the holy spirit, philip, prochorus, nicanor, timon, parmenas, and nicolaus, a proselyte of antioch;
whom they set before the apostles
when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them
the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem exceedingly
a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people
but some of those who were of the synagogue called the libertines, and of the cyrenians, of the alexandrians, and of those of cilicia and asia arose, disputing with stephen
they werent able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke
then they secretly induced men to say, we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and god
they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,
and set up false witnesses who said, this man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law
for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which moses delivered to us
all who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel
the high priest said, are these things so?
he said, brothers and fathers, listen
the god of glory appeared to our father abraham, when he was in mesopotamia, before he lived in haran,
and said to him, get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which i will show you
then he came out of the land of the chaldaeans, and lived in haran
from there, when his father was dead, god moved him into this land, where you are now living
he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on
he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child
god spoke in this way
that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years
i will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage, said god, and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place
he gave him the covenant of circumcision
so abraham became the father of isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day
isaac became the father of jacob, and jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs
the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against joseph, sold him into egypt
god was with him,
and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before pharaoh, king of egypt
he made him governor over egypt and all his house
now a famine came over all the land of egypt and canaan, and great affliction
our fathers found no food
but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time
on the second time joseph was made known to his brothers, and josephs race was revealed to pharaoh
joseph sent, and summoned jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls
jacob went down into egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers,
and they were brought back to shechem, and laid in the tomb that abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of hamor of shechem
but as the time of the promise came close which god had sworn to abraham, the people grew and multiplied in egypt,
until there arose a different king, who didnt know joseph
the same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldnt stay alive
at that time moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome
he was nourished three months in his fathers house
when he was thrown out, pharaohs daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son
moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians
he was mighty in his words and works
but when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of israel
seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the egyptian
he supposed that his brothers understood that god, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didnt understand
the day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, sirs, you are brothers
why do you wrong one another?
but he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
do you want to kill me, as you killed the egyptian yesterday?
moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of midian, where he became the father of two sons
when forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the lord appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush
when moses saw it, he wondered at the sight
as he came close to see, a voice of the lord came to him,
i am the god of your fathers, the god of abraham, the god of isaac, and the god of jacob
moses trembled, and dared not look
the lord said to him, take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground
i have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in egypt, and have heard their groaning
i have come down to deliver them
now come, i will send you into egypt
this moses, whom they refused, saying, who made you a ruler and a judge?--god has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush
this man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in egypt, in the red sea, and in the wilderness for forty years
this is that moses, who said to the children of israel, the lord our god will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me
this is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on mount sinai, and with our fathers, who received living oracles to give to us,
to whom our fathers wouldnt be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to egypt,
saying to aaron, make us gods that will go before us, for as for this moses, who led us out of the land of egypt, we dont know what has become of him
they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands
but god turned, and gave them up to serve the army of the sky, as it is written in the book of the prophets, did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, o house of israel?
you took up the tabernacle of moloch, the star of your god rephan, the figures which you made to worship
i will carry you away beyond babylon
our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;
which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom god drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of david,
who found favor in the sight of god, and asked to find a habitation for the god of jacob
but solomon built him a house
however, the most high doesnt dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,
heaven is my throne, and the earth a footstool for my feet
what kind of house will you build me? says the lord; or what is the place of my rest?
didnt my hand make all these things?
you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the holy spirit! as your fathers did, so you do
which of the prophets didnt your fathers persecute? they killed those who foretold the coming of the righteous one, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers
you received the law as it was ordained by angels, and didnt keep it!
now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth
but he, being full of the holy spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of god, and jesus standing on the right hand of god,
and said, behold, i see the heavens opened, and the son of man standing at the right hand of god!
but they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one accord
they threw him out of the city, and stoned him
the witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named saul
they stoned stephen as he called out, saying, lord jesus, receive my spirit!
he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, lord, dont hold this sin against them! when he had said this, he fell asleep
saul was consenting to his death
a great persecution arose against the assembly which was in jerusalem in that day
they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria, except for the apostles
devout men buried stephen, and lamented greatly over him
but saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison
therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word
philip went down to the city of samaria, and proclaimed to them the christ
the multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did
for unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them
they came out, crying with a loud voice
many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed
there was great joy in that city
but there was a certain man, simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of samaria, making himself out to be some great one,
to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, this man is that great power of god
they listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries
but when they believed philip preaching good news concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ, they were baptized, both men and women
simon himself also believed
being baptized, he continued with philip
seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed
now when the apostles who were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god, they sent peter and john to them,
who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the holy spirit;
for as yet he had fallen on none of them
they had only been baptized in the name of christ jesus
then they laid their hands on them, and they received the holy spirit
now when simon saw that the holy spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands, he offered them money,
saying, give me also this power, that whomever i lay my hands on may receive the holy spirit
but peter said to him, may your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of god with money!
you have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isnt right before god
repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask god if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you
for i see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity
simon answered, pray for me to the lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me
they therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the lord, returned to jerusalem, and preached the good news to many villages of the samaritans
but an angel of the lord spoke to philip, saying, arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from jerusalem to gaza
this is a desert
he arose and went; and behold, there was a man of ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under candace, queen of the ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to jerusalem to worship
he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet isaiah
the spirit said to philip, go near, and join yourself to this chariot
philip ran to him, and heard him reading isaiah the prophet, and said, do you understand what you are reading?
he said, how can i, unless someone explains it to me? he begged philip to come up and sit with him
now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this, he was led as a sheep to the slaughter
as a lamb before his shearer is silent, so he doesnt open his mouth
in his humiliation, his judgment was taken away
who will declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth
the eunuch answered philip, who is the prophet talking about? about himself, or about someone else?
philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached to him jesus
as they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, behold, here is water
what is keeping me from being baptized?
he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him
when they came up out of the water, the spirit of the lord caught philip away, and the eunuch didnt see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing
but philip was found at azotus
passing through, he preached the good news to all the cities, until he came to caesarea
but saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the lord, went to the high priest,
and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of damascus, that if he found any who were of the way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to jerusalem
as he traveled, it happened that he got close to damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him
he fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, saul, saul, why do you persecute me?
he said, who are you, lord? the lord said, i am jesus, whom you are persecuting
but rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do
the men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one
saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one
they led him by the hand, and brought him into damascus
he was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank
now there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias
the lord said to him in a vision, ananias! he said, behold, its me, lord
the lord said to him, arise, and go to the street which is called straight, and inquire in the house of judah for one named saul, a man of tarsus
for behold, he is praying,
and in a vision he has seen a man named ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight
but ananias answered, lord, i have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at jerusalem
here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name
but the lord said to him, go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the children of israel
for i will show him how many things he must suffer for my names sake
ananias departed, and entered into the house
laying his hands on him, he said, brother saul, the lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the holy spirit
immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight
he arose and was baptized
he took food and was strengthened
saul stayed several days with the disciples who were at damascus
immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed the christ, that he is the son of god
all who heard him were amazed, and said, isnt this he who in jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? and he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!
but saul increased more in strength, and confounded the jews who lived at damascus, proving that this is the christ
when many days were fulfilled, the jews conspired together to kill him,
but their plot became known to saul
they watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,
but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket
when saul had come to jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple
but barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at damascus he had preached boldly in the name of jesus
he was with them entering into jerusalem,
preaching boldly in the name of the lord jesus
he spoke and disputed against the hellenists, but they were seeking to kill him
when the brothers knew it, they brought him down to caesarea, and sent him off to tarsus
so the assemblies throughout all judea and galilee and samaria had peace, and were built up
they were multiplied, walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit
it happened, as peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at lydda
there he found a certain man named aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed
peter said to him, aeneas, jesus christ heals you
get up and make your bed! immediately he arose
all who lived at lydda and in sharon saw him, and they turned to the lord
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha, which when translated, means dorcas
this woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did
it happened in those days that she fell sick, and died
when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room
as lydda was near joppa, the disciples, hearing that peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them
peter got up and went with them
when he had come, they brought him into the upper room
all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which dorcas had made while she was with them
peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed
turning to the body, he said, tabitha, get up! she opened her eyes, and when she saw peter, she sat up
he gave her his hand, and raised her up
calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive
and it became known throughout all joppa, and many believed in the lord
it happened, that he stayed many days in joppa with one simon, a tanner
now there was a certain man in caesarea, cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the italian regiment,
a devout man, and one who feared god with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to god
at about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of god coming to him, and saying to him, cornelius!
he, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, what is it, lord? he said to him, your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before god
now send men to joppa, and get simon, who is surnamed peter
he lodges with one simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside
when the angel who spoke to him had departed, cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually
having explained everything to them, he sent them to joppa
now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon
he became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance
he saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,
in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky
a voice came to him, rise, peter, kill and eat!
but peter said, not so, lord; for i have never eaten anything that is common or unclean
a voice came to him again the second time, what god has cleansed, you must not call unclean
this was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven
now while peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by cornelius, having made inquiry for simons house, stood before the gate,
and called and asked whether simon, who was surnamed peter, was lodging there
while peter was pondering the vision, the spirit said to him, behold, three men seek you
but arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for i have sent them
peter went down to the men, and said, behold, i am he whom you seek
why have you come?
they said, cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears god, and well spoken of by all the nation of the jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say
so he called them in and lodged them
on the next day peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from joppa accompanied him
on the next day they entered into caesarea
cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends
when it happened that peter entered, cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him
but peter raised him up, saying, stand up! i myself am also a man
as he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together
he said to them, you yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but god has shown me that i shouldnt call any man unholy or unclean
therefore also i came without complaint when i was sent for
i ask therefore, why did you send for me?
cornelius said, four days ago, i was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour, i prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
and said, cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of god
send therefore to joppa, and summon simon, who is surnamed peter
he lodges in the house of simon a tanner, by the seaside
when he comes, he will speak to you
therefore i sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come
now therefore we are all here present in the sight of god to hear all things that have been commanded you by god
peter opened his mouth and said, truly i perceive that god doesnt show favoritism;
but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him
the word which he sent to the children of israel, preaching good news of peace by jesus christ--he is lord of all--
you yourselves know what happened, which was proclaimed throughout all judea, beginning from galilee, after the baptism which john preached;
even jesus of nazareth, how god anointed him with the holy spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for god was with him
we are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the jews, and in jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree
god raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,
not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by god, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead
he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by god as the judge of the living and the dead
all the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins
while peter was still speaking these words, the holy spirit fell on all those who heard the word
they of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with peter, because the gift of the holy spirit was also poured out on the gentiles
for they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying god
then peter answered,
can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the holy spirit as well as we should not be baptized?
he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ
then they asked him to stay some days
now the apostles and the brothers who were in judea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god
when peter had come up to jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,
saying, you went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!
but peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,
i was in the city of joppa praying, and in a trance i saw a vision
a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners
it came as far as me
when i had looked intently at it, i considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky
i also heard a voice saying to me, rise, peter, kill and eat!
but i said, not so, lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth
but a voice answered me the second time out of heaven, what god has cleansed, dont you call unclean
this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven
behold, immediately three men stood before the house where i was, having been sent from caesarea to me
the spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating
these six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the mans house
he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, send to joppa, and get simon, whose surname is peter,
who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house
as i began to speak, the holy spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning
i remembered the word of the lord, how he said, john indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the holy spirit
if then god gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the lord jesus christ, who was i, that i could withstand god?
when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified god, saying, then god has also granted to the gentiles repentance to life!
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about stephen traveled as far as phoenicia, cyprus, and antioch, speaking the word to no one except to jews only
but there were some of them, men of cyprus and cyrene, who, when they had come to antioch, spoke to the hellenists, preaching the lord jesus
the hand of the lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the lord
the report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in jerusalem
they sent out barnabas to go as far as antioch,
who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of god, was glad
he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the lord
for he was a good man, and full of the holy spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the lord
barnabas went out to tarsus to look for saul
when he had found him, he brought him to antioch
it happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people
the disciples were first called christians in antioch
now in these days, prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch
one of them named agabus stood up, and indicated by the spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of claudius
as any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in judea;
which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul
now about that time, king herod stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly
he killed james, the brother of john, with the sword
when he saw that it pleased the jews, he proceeded to seize peter also
this was during the days of unleavened bread
when he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the passover
peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to god for him
the same night when herod was about to bring him out, peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains
guards in front of the door kept the prison
and behold, an angel of the lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell
he struck peter on the side, and woke him up, saying, stand up quickly! his chains fell off from his hands
the angel said to him, get dressed and put on your sandals
he did so
he said to him, put on your cloak, and follow me
and he went out and followed him
he didnt know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision
when they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself
they went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him
when peter had come to himself, he said, now i truly know that the lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of herod, and from everything the jewish people were expecting
thinking about that, he came to the house of mary, the mother of john whose surname was mark, where many were gathered together and were praying
when peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named rhoda came to answer
when she recognized peters voice, she didnt open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that peter was standing in front of the gate
they said to her, you are crazy! but she insisted that it was so
they said, it is his angel
but peter continued knocking
when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed
but he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the lord had brought him out of the prison
he said, tell these things to james, and to the brothers
then he departed, and went to another place
now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of peter
when herod had sought for him, and didnt find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death
he went down from judea to caesarea, and stayed there
now herod was very angry with the people of tyre and sidon
they came with one accord to him, and, having made blastus, the kings personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the kings country for food
on an appointed day, herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them
the people shouted, the voice of a god, and not of a man!
immediately an angel of the lord struck him, because he didnt give god the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died
but the word of god grew and multiplied
barnabas and saul returned to jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them john whose surname was mark
now in the assembly that was at antioch there were some prophets and teachers
barnabas, simeon who was called niger, lucius of cyrene, manaen the foster brother of herod the tetrarch, and saul
as they served the lord and fasted, the holy spirit said, separate barnabas and saul for me, for the work to which i have called them
then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away
so, being sent out by the holy spirit, they went down to seleucia
from there they sailed to cyprus
when they were at salamis, they proclaimed the word of god in the jewish synagogues
they had also john as their attendant
when they had gone through the island to paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a jew, whose name was bar jesus,
who was with the proconsul, sergius paulus, a man of understanding
this man summoned barnabas and saul, and sought to hear the word of god
but elymas the sorcerer  withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith
but saul, who is also called paul, filled with the holy spirit, fastened his eyes on him,
and said, full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord?
now, behold, the hand of the lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season! immediately a mist and darkness fell on him
he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand
then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the lord
now paul and his company set sail from paphos, and came to perga in pamphylia
john departed from them and returned to jerusalem
but they, passing on from perga, came to antioch of pisidia
they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down
after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak
paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, men of israel, and you who fear god, listen
the god of this people chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it
for a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness
when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred fifty years
after these things he gave them judges until samuel the prophet
afterward they asked for a king, and god gave to them saul the son of kish, a man of the tribe of benjamin, for forty years
when he had removed him, he raised up david to be their king, to whom he also testified, i have found david the son of jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will
from this mans seed, god has brought salvation to israel according to his promise,
before his coming, when john had first preached the baptism of repentance to israel
as john was fulfilling his course, he said, what do you suppose that i am? i am not he
but behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet i am not worthy to untie
brothers, children of the stock of abraham, and those among you who fear god, the word of this salvation is sent out to you
for those who dwell in jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didnt know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him
though they found no cause for death, they still asked pilate to have him killed
when they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb
but god raised him from the dead,
and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from galilee to jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people
we bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,
that god has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up jesus
as it is also written in the second psalm, you are my son
today i have become your father
concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus
i will give you the holy and sure blessings of david
therefore he says also in another psalm, you will not allow your holy one to see decay
for david, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of god, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw decay
but he whom god raised up saw no decay
be it known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,
and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of moses
beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets
behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for i work a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you
so when the jews went out of the synagogue, the gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
now when the synagogue broke up, many of the jews and of the devout proselytes followed paul and barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of god
the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of god
but when the jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by paul, and blasphemed
paul and barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, it was necessary that gods word should be spoken to you first
since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the gentiles
for so has the lord commanded us, saying, i have set you as a light for the gentiles, that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth
as the gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of god
as many as were appointed to eternal life believed
the lords word was spread abroad throughout all the region
but the jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against paul and barnabas, and threw them out of their borders
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to iconium
the disciples were filled with joy with the holy spirit
it happened in iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of jews and of greeks believed
but the disbelieving jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the gentiles against the brothers
therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands
but the multitude of the city was divided
part sided with the jews, and part with the apostles
when some of both the gentiles and the jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,
they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of lycaonia, lystra, derbe, and the surrounding region
there they preached the good news
at lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mothers womb, who never had walked
he was listening to paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,
said with a loud voice, stand upright on your feet! he leaped up and walked
when the multitude saw what paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of lycaonia, the gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!
they called barnabas jupiter, and paul mercury, because he was the chief speaker
the priest of jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes
but when the apostles, barnabas and paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,
men, why are you doing these things? we also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living god, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;
who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways
yet he didnt leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness
even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them
but some jews from antioch and iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead
but as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city
on the next day he went out with barnabas to derbe
when they had preached the good news to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to lystra, iconium, and antioch,
confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of god
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the lord, on whom they had believed
they passed through pisidia, and came to pamphylia
when they had spoken the word in perga, they went down to attalia
from there they sailed to antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of god for the work which they had fulfilled
when they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that god had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations
they stayed there with the disciples for a long time
some men came down from judea and taught the brothers, unless you are circumcised after the custom of moses, you cant be saved
therefore when paul and barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed paul and barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question
they, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both phoenicia and samaria, declaring the conversion of the gentiles
they caused great joy to all the brothers
when they had come to jerusalem, they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that god had done with them
but some of the sect of the pharisees who believed rose up, saying, it is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of moses
the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter
when there had been much discussion, peter rose up and said to them, brothers, you know that a good while ago god made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the good news, and believe
god, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the holy spirit, just like he did to us
he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith
now therefore why do you tempt god, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
but we believe that we are saved through the grace of the lord jesus, just as they are
all the multitude kept silence, and they listened to barnabas and paul reporting what signs and wonders god had done among the nations through them
after they were silent, james answered, brothers, listen to me
simeon has reported how god first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name
this agrees with the words of the prophets
as it is written,
after these things i will return
i will again build the tabernacle of david, which has fallen
i will again build its ruins
i will set it up,
that the rest of men may seek after the lord; all the gentiles who are called by my name, says the lord, who does all these things
all his works are known to god from eternity
therefore my judgment is that we dont trouble those from among the gentiles who turn to god,
but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood
for moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath
then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out of their company, and send them to antioch with paul and barnabas
judas called barsabbas, and silas, chief men among the brothers
they wrote these things by their hand
the apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the gentiles in antioch, syria, and cilicia
greetings
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, you must be circumcised and keep the law, to whom we gave no commandment;
it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved barnabas and paul,
men who have risked their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
we have sent therefore judas and silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth
for it seemed good to the holy spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things
that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you
farewell
so, when they were sent off, they came to antioch
having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter
when they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement
judas and silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them
after they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles
but paul and barnabas stayed in antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the lord, with many others also
after some days paul said to barnabas, lets return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the lord, to see how they are doing
barnabas planned to take john, who was called mark, with them also
but paul didnt think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in pamphylia, and didnt go with them to do the work
then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other
barnabas took mark with him, and sailed away to cyprus,
but paul chose silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of god
he went through syria and cilicia, strengthening the assemblies
he came to derbe and lystra
and behold, a certain disciple was there, named timothy, the son of a jewess who believed; but his father was a greek
the brothers who were at lystra and iconium gave a good testimony about him
paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a greek
as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at jerusalem
so the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily
when they had gone through the region of phrygia and galatia, they were forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in asia
when they had come opposite mysia, they tried to go into bithynia, but the spirit didnt allow them
passing by mysia, they came down to troas
a vision appeared to paul in the night
there was a man of macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, come over into macedonia and help us
when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to macedonia, concluding that the lord had called us to preach the good news to them
setting sail therefore from troas, we made a straight course to samothrace, and the day following to neapolis;
and from there to philippi, which is a city of macedonia, the foremost of the district, a roman colony
we were staying some days in this city
on the sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together
a certain woman named lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of thyatira, one who worshiped god, heard us; whose heart the lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by paul
when she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, if you have judged me to be faithful to the lord, come into my house, and stay
so she persuaded us
it happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling
following paul and us, she cried out, these men are servants of the most high god, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!
she was doing this for many days
but paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, i command you in the name of jesus christ to come out of her! it came out that very hour
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized paul and silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers
when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, these men, being jews, are agitating our city,
and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being romans
the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods
when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,
who, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks
but about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god, and the prisoners were listening to them
suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyones bonds were loosened
the jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped
but paul cried with a loud voice, saying, dont harm yourself, for we are all here!
he called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before paul and silas,
and brought them out and said, sirs, what must i do to be saved?
they said, believe in the lord jesus christ, and you will be saved, you and your household
they spoke the word of the lord to him, and to all who were in his house
he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household
he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in god
but when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, let those men go
the jailer reported these words to paul, saying, the magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace
but paul said to them, they have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are romans, and have cast us into prison! do they now release us secretly? no, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!
the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were romans,
and they came and begged them
when they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city
they went out of the prison, and entered into lydias house
when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia, they came to thessalonica, where there was a jewish synagogue
paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures,
explaining and demonstrating that the christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, this jesus, whom i proclaim to you, is the christ
some of them were persuaded, and joined paul and silas, of the devout greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women
but the unpersuaded jews took along some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar
assaulting the house of jason, they sought to bring them out to the people
when they didnt find them, they dragged jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, these who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
whom jason has received
these all act contrary to the decrees of caesar, saying that there is another king, jesus!
the multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things
when they had taken security from jason and the rest, they let them go
the brothers immediately sent paul and silas away by night to beroea
when they arrived, they went into the jewish synagogue
now these were more noble than those in thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were so
many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent greek women, and not a few men
but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was proclaimed by paul at beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes
then the brothers immediately sent out paul to go as far as to the sea, and silas and timothy still stayed there
but those who escorted paul brought him as far as athens
receiving a commandment to silas and timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed
now while paul waited for them at athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols
so he reasoned in the synagogue with the jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him
some of the epicurean and stoic philosophers also were conversing with him
some said, what does this babbler want to say? others said, he seems to be advocating foreign deities, because he preached jesus and the resurrection
they took hold of him, and brought him to the areopagus, saying, may we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?
for you bring certain strange things to our ears
we want to know therefore what these things mean
now all the athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing
paul stood in the middle of the areopagus, and said, you men of athens, i perceive that you are very religious in all things
for as i passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, i found also an altar with this inscription
to an unknown god
what therefore you worship in ignorance, this i announce to you
the god who made the world and all things in it, he, being lord of heaven and earth, doesnt dwell in temples made with hands,
neither is he served by mens hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,
that they should seek the lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us
for in him we live, and move, and have our being
as some of your own poets have said, for we are also his offspring
being then the offspring of god, we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man
the times of ignorance therefore god overlooked
but now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,
because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead
now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, we want to hear you again concerning this
thus paul went out from among them
but certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was dionysius the areopagite, and a woman named damaris, and others with them
after these things paul departed from athens, and came to corinth
he found a certain jew named aquila, a man of pontus by race, who had recently come from italy, with his wife priscilla, because claudius had commanded all the jews to depart from rome
he came to them,
and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers
he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded jews and greeks
but when silas and timothy came down from macedonia, paul was compelled by the spirit, testifying to the jews that jesus was the christ
when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, your blood be on your own heads! i am clean
from now on, i will go to the gentiles!
he departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named justus, one who worshiped god, whose house was next door to the synagogue
crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the lord with all his house
many of the corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized
the lord said to paul in the night by a vision, dont be afraid, but speak and dont be silent;
for i am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for i have many people in this city
he lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of god among them
but when gallio was proconsul of achaia, the jews with one accord rose up against paul and brought him before the judgment seat,
saying, this man persuades men to worship god contrary to the law
but when paul was about to open his mouth, gallio said to the jews, if indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you jews, it would be reasonable that i should bear with you;
but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves
for i dont want to be a judge of these matters
he drove them from the judgment seat
then all the greeks laid hold on sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat
gallio didnt care about any of these things
paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for syria, together with priscilla and aquila
he shaved his head in cenchreae, for he had a vow
he came to ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the jews
when they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;
but taking his leave of them, and saying, i must by all means keep this coming feast in jerusalem, but i will return again to you if god wills, he set sail from ephesus
when he had landed at caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to antioch
having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of galatia, and phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples
now a certain jew named apollos, an alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to ephesus
he was mighty in the scriptures
this man had been instructed in the way of the lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning jesus, although he knew only the baptism of john
he began to speak boldly in the synagogue
but when priscilla and aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of god more accurately
when he had determined to pass over into achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him
when he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;
for he powerfully refuted the jews, publicly showing by the scriptures that jesus was the christ
it happened that, while apollos was at corinth, paul, having passed through the upper country, came to ephesus, and found certain disciples
he said to them, did you receive the holy spirit when you believed? they said to him, no, we havent even heard that there is a holy spirit
he said, into what then were you baptized? they said, into johns baptism
paul said, john indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in jesus
when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
when paul had laid his hands on them, the holy spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied
they were about twelve men in all
he entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the kingdom of god
but when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of tyrannus
this continued for two years, so that all those who lived in asia heard the word of the lord jesus, both jews and greeks
god worked special miracles by the hands of paul,
so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out
but some of the itinerant jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the lord jesus, saying, we adjure you by jesus whom paul preaches
there were seven sons of one sceva, a jewish chief priest, who did this
the evil spirit answered, jesus i know, and paul i know, but who are you?
the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
this became known to all, both jews and greeks, who lived at ephesus
fear fell on them all, and the name of the lord jesus was magnified
many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all
they counted their price, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver
so the word of the lord was growing and becoming mighty
now after these things had ended, paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through macedonia and achaia, to go to jerusalem, saying, after i have been there, i must also see rome
having sent into macedonia two of those who served him, timothy and erastus, he himself stayed in asia for a while
about that time there arose no small stir concerning the way
for a certain man named demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,
whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth
you see and hear, that not at ephesus alone, but almost throughout all asia, this paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands
not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all asia and the world worships
when they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, great is artemis of the ephesians!
the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized gaius and aristarchus, men of macedonia, pauls companions in travel
when paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didnt allow him
certain also of the asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater
some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion
most of them didnt know why they had come together
they brought alexander out of the multitude, the jews putting him forward
alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people
but when they perceived that he was a jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, great is artemis of the ephesians!
when the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, you men of ephesus, what man is there who doesnt know that the city of the ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess artemis, and of the image which fell down from zeus?
seeing then that these things cant be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash
for you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess
if therefore demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls
let them press charges against one another
but if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this days riot, there being no cause
concerning it, we wouldnt be able to give an account of this commotion
when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly
after the uproar had ceased, paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into macedonia
when he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into greece
when he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by jews as he was about to set sail for syria, he determined to return through macedonia
these accompanied him as far as asia
sopater of beroea; aristarchus and secundus of the thessalonians; gaius of derbe; timothy; and tychicus and trophimus of asia
but these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at troas
we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at troas in five days, where we stayed seven days
on the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight
there were many lights in the upper room where we were gathered together
a certain young man named eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep
as paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead
paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, dont be troubled, for his life is in him
when he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed
they brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted
but we who went ahead to the ship set sail for assos, intending to take paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land
when he met us at assos, we took him aboard, and came to mitylene
sailing from there, we came the following day opposite chios
the next day we touched at samos and stayed at trogyllium, and the day after we came to miletus
for paul had determined to sail past ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in jerusalem on the day of pentecost
from miletus he sent to ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly
when they had come to him, he said to them, you yourselves know, from the first day that i set foot in asia, how i was with you all the time,
serving the lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the jews;
how i didnt shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,
testifying both to jews and to greeks repentance toward god, and faith toward our lord jesus
now, behold, i go bound by the spirit to jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;
except that the holy spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me
but these things dont count; nor do i hold my life dear to myself, so that i may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which i received from the lord jesus, to fully testify to the good news of the grace of god
now, behold, i know that you all, among whom i went about preaching the kingdom of god, will see my face no more
therefore i testify to you this day that i am clean from the blood of all men,
for i didnt shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of god
take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the holy spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the lord and god which he purchased with his own blood
for i know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock
men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them
therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years i didnt cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears
now, brothers, i entrust you to god, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified
i coveted no ones silver, or gold, or clothing
you yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me
in all things i gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the lord jesus, that he himself said, it is more blessed to give than to receive
when he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all
they all wept a lot, and fell on pauls neck and kissed him,
sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more
and they accompanied him to the ship
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to cos, and the next day to rhodes, and from there to patara
having found a ship crossing over to phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail
when we had come in sight of cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to syria, and landed at tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo
having found disciples, we stayed there seven days
these said to paul through the spirit, that he should not go up to jerusalem
when it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey
they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city
kneeling down on the beach, we prayed
after saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again
when we had finished the voyage from tyre, we arrived at ptolemais
we greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day
on the next day, we, who were pauls companions, departed, and came to caesarea
we entered into the house of philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him
now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied
as we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named agabus came down from judea
coming to us, and taking pauls belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, thus says the holy spirit
so will the jews at jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the gentiles
when we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to jerusalem
then paul answered, what are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? for i am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, the lords will be done
after these days we took up our baggage and went up to jerusalem
some of the disciples from caesarea also went with us, bringing one mnason of cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay
when we had come to jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly
the day following, paul went in with us to james; and all the elders were present
when he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which god had worked among the gentiles through his ministry
they, when they heard it, glorified god
they said to him, you see, brother, how many thousands there are among the jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law
they have been informed about you, that you teach all the jews who are among the gentiles to forsake moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs
what then? the assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come
therefore do what we tell you
we have four men who have taken a vow
take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads
then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law
but concerning the gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality
then paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them
when the seven days were almost completed, the jews from asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,
crying out, men of israel, help! this is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place
moreover, he also brought greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!
for they had seen trophimus, the ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that paul had brought him into the temple
all the city was moved, and the people ran together
they seized paul and dragged him out of the temple
immediately the doors were shut
as they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all jerusalem was in an uproar
immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them
they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating paul
then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done
some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd
when he couldnt find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks
when he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, away with him!
as paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, may i speak to you? he said, do you know greek?
arent you then the egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?
but paul said, i am a jew, from tarsus in cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city
i beg you, allow me to speak to the people
when he had given him permission, paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people
when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the hebrew language, saying,
brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which i now make to you
when they heard that he spoke to them in the hebrew language, they were even more quiet
he said,
i am indeed a jew, born in tarsus of cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel, instructed according to the strict tradition of the law of our fathers, being zealous for god, even as you all are this day
i persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women
as also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also i received letters to the brothers, and traveled to damascus to bring them also who were there to jerusalem in bonds to be punished
it happened that, as i made my journey, and came close to damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me
i fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, saul, saul, why are you persecuting me?
i answered, who are you, lord? he said to me, i am jesus of nazareth, whom you persecute
those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didnt understand the voice of him who spoke to me
i said, what shall i do, lord? the lord said to me, arise, and go into damascus
there you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do
when i couldnt see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, i came into damascus
one ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the jews who lived in damascus,
came to me, and standing by me said to me, brother saul, receive your sight! in that very hour i looked up at him
he said, the god of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the righteous one, and to hear a voice from his mouth
for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard
now why do you wait? arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the lord
it happened that, when i had returned to jerusalem, and while i prayed in the temple, i fell into a trance,
and saw him saying to me, hurry and get out of jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you
i said, lord, they themselves know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you
when the blood of stephen, your witness, was shed, i also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him
he said to me, depart, for i will send you out far from here to the gentiles
they listened to him until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, rid the earth of this fellow, for he isnt fit to live!
as they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,
the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like that
when they had tied him up with thongs, paul asked the centurion who stood by, is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a roman, and not found guilty?
when the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, watch what you are about to do, for this man is a roman!
the commanding officer came and asked him, tell me, are you a roman? he said, yes
the commanding officer answered, i bought my citizenship for a great price
paul said, but i was born a roman
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a roman, because he had bound him
but on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought paul down and set him before them
paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, brothers, i have lived before god in all good conscience until this day
the high priest, ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth
then paul said to him, god will strike you, you whitewashed wall! do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?
those who stood by said, do you malign gods high priest?
paul said, i didnt know, brothers, that he was high priest
for it is written, you shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees, he cried out in the council, men and brothers, i am a pharisee, a son of pharisees
concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead i am being judged!
when he had said this, an argument arose between the pharisees and sadducees, and the assembly was divided
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the pharisees confess all of these
a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, we find no evil in this man
but if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, lets not fight against god!
when a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks
the following night, the lord stood by him, and said, cheer up, paul, for as you have testified about me at jerusalem, so you must testify also at rome
when it was day, some of the jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed paul
there were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy
they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, we have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed paul
now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly
we are ready to kill him before he comes near
but pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told paul
paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him
so he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you
the commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, what is it that you have to tell me?
he said, the jews have agreed to ask you to bring paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him
therefore dont yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him
now they are ready, looking for the promise from you
so the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, tell no one that you have revealed these things to me
he called to himself two of the centurions, and said, prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night 
he asked them to provide animals, that they might set paul on one, and bring him safely to felix the governor
he wrote a letter like this
claudius lysias to the most excellent governor felix
greetings
this man was seized by the jews, and was about to be killed by them, when i came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a roman
desiring to know the cause why they accused him, i brought him down to their council
i found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment
when i was told that the jews lay in wait for the man, i sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you
farewell
so the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took paul and brought him by night to antipatris
but on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks
when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented paul to him
when the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from
when he understood that he was from cilicia, he said,
i will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive
he commanded that he be kept in herods palace
after five days, the high priest, ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one tertullus
they informed the governor against paul
when he was called, tertullus began to accuse him, saying, seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,
we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent felix, with all thankfulness
but, that i dont delay you, i entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words
for we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
he even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him
by examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him
the jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so
when the governor had beckoned to him to speak, paul answered, because i know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, i cheerfully make my defense,
seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship at jerusalem
in the temple they didnt find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city
nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me
but this i confess to you, that after the way, which they call a sect, so i serve the god of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;
having hope toward god, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust
herein i also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward god and men
now after some years, i came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;
amid which certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil
they ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me
or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when i stood before the council,
unless it is for this one thing that i cried standing among them, concerning the resurrection of the dead i am being judged before you today!
but felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the way, deferred them, saying, when lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, i will decide your case
he ordered the centurion that paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him
but after some days, felix came with drusilla, his wife, who was a jewess, and sent for paul, and heard him concerning the faith in christ jesus
as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, felix was terrified, and answered, go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, i will summon you
meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by paul, that he might release him
therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him
but when two years were fulfilled, felix was succeeded by porcius festus, and desiring to gain favor with the jews, felix left paul in bonds
festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to jerusalem from caesarea
then the high priest and the principal men of the jews informed him against paul, and they begged him,
asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way
however festus answered that paul should be kept in custody at caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly
let them therefore, said he, that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him
when he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded paul to be brought
when he had come, the jews who had come down from jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,
while he said in his defense, neither against the law of the jews, nor against the temple, nor against caesar, have i sinned at all
but festus, desiring to gain favor with the jews, answered paul and said, are you willing to go up to jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?
but paul said, i am standing before caesars judgment seat, where i ought to be tried
i have done no wrong to the jews, as you also know very well
for if i have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, i dont refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them
i appeal to caesar!
then festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, you have appealed to caesar
to caesar you shall go
now when some days had passed, king agrippa and bernice arrived at caesarea, and greeted festus
as he stayed there many days, festus laid pauls case before the king, saying, there is a certain man left a prisoner by felix;
about whom, when i was at jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him
to whom i answered that it is not the custom of the romans to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him
when therefore they had come together here, i didnt delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought
concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as i supposed;
but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one jesus, who was dead, whom paul affirmed to be alive
being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, i asked whether he was willing to go to jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters
but when paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, i commanded him to be kept until i could send him to caesar
agrippa said to festus, i also would like to hear the man myself
tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him
so on the next day, when agrippa and bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of festus, paul was brought in
festus said, king agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the jews petitioned me, both at jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor i determined to send him
of whom i have no certain thing to write to my lord
therefore i have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, king agrippa, that, after examination, i may have something to write
for it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him
agrippa said to paul, you may speak for yourself
then paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense
i think myself happy, king agrippa, that i am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that i am accused by the jews,
especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews
therefore i beg you to hear me patiently
indeed, all the jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at jerusalem;
having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee
now i stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by god to our fathers,
which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain
concerning this hope i am accused by the jews, king agrippa!
why is it judged incredible with you, if god does raise the dead?
i myself most certainly thought that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth
this i also did in jerusalem
i both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death i gave my vote against them
punishing them often in all the synagogues, i tried to make them blaspheme
being exceedingly enraged against them, i persecuted them even to foreign cities
whereupon as i traveled to damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,
at noon, o king, i saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me
when we had all fallen to the earth, i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language, saul, saul, why are you persecuting me? it is hard for you to kick against the goads
i said, who are you, lord? he said, i am jesus, whom you are persecuting
but arise, and stand on your feet, for i have appeared to you for this purpose
to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which i will reveal to you;
delivering you from the people, and from the gentiles, to whom i send you,
to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me
therefore, king agrippa, i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
but declared first to them of damascus, at jerusalem, and throughout all the country of judea, and also to the gentiles, that they should repent and turn to god, doing works worthy of repentance
for this reason the jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me
having therefore obtained the help that is from god, i stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would happen,
how the christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the gentiles
as he thus made his defense, festus said with a loud voice, paul, you are crazy! your great learning is driving you insane!
but he said, i am not crazy, most excellent festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness
for the king knows of these things, to whom also i speak freely
for i am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner
king agrippa, do you believe the prophets? i know that you believe
agrippa said to paul, with a little persuasion are you trying to make me a christian?
paul said, i pray to god, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as i am, except for these bonds
the king rose up with the governor, and bernice, and those who sat with them
when they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, this man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds
agrippa said to festus, this man might have been set free if he had not appealed to caesar
when it was determined that we should sail for italy, they delivered paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named julius, of the augustan band
embarking in a ship of adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of asia, we put to sea; aristarchus, a macedonian of thessalonica, being with us
the next day, we touched at sidon
julius treated paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself
putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of cyprus, because the winds were contrary
when we had sailed across the sea which is off cilicia and pamphylia, we came to myra, a city of lycia
there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing for italy, and he put us on board
when we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of crete, opposite salmone
with difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called fair havens, near the city of lasea
when much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the fast had now already gone by, paul admonished them,
and said to them, sirs, i perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives
but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by paul
because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of crete, looking northeast and southeast
when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along crete, close to shore
but before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called euroclydon
when the ship was caught, and couldnt face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along
running under the lee of a small island called clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat
after they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship
fearing that they would run aground on the syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along
as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard
on the third day, they threw out the ships tackle with their own hands
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away
when they had been long without food, paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from crete, and have gotten this injury and loss
now i exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship
for there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the god whose i am and whom i serve,
saying, dont be afraid, paul
you must stand before caesar
behold, god has granted you all those who sail with you
therefore, sirs, cheer up! for i believe god, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me
but we must run aground on a certain island
but when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the adriatic sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land
they took soundings, and found twenty fathoms
after a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms
fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, unless these stay in the ship, you cant be saved
then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off
while the day was coming on, paul begged them all to take some food, saying, this day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing
therefore i beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads
when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to god in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat
then they all cheered up, and they also took food
in all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship
when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea
when it was day, they didnt recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it
casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes
hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach
but coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground
the bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves
the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape
but the centurion, desiring to save paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;
and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship
so it happened that they all escaped safely to the land
when we had escaped, then they learned that the island was called malta
the natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold
but when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand
when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, no doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet justice has not allowed to live
however he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasnt harmed
but they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god
now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days
it happened that the father of publius lay sick of fever and dysentery
paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him
then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured
they also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed
after three months, we set sail in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was the twin brothers
touching at syracuse, we stayed there three days
from there we circled around and arrived at rhegium
after one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to puteoli,
where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days
so we came to rome
from there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as the market of appius and the three taverns
when paul saw them, he thanked god, and took courage
when we entered into rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him
it happened that after three days paul called together those who were the leaders of the jews
when they had come together, he said to them, i, brothers, though i had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans,
who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me
but when the jews spoke against it, i was constrained to appeal to caesar, not that i had anything about which to accuse my nation
for this cause therefore i asked to see you and to speak with you
for because of the hope of israel i am bound with this chain
they said to him, we neither received letters from judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you
but we desire to hear from you what you think
for, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against
when they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging
he explained to them, testifying about the kingdom of god, and persuading them concerning jesus, both from the law of moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening
some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved
when they didnt agree among themselves, they departed after paul had spoken one word, the holy spirit spoke rightly through isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,
saying, go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand
in seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive
for this peoples heart has grown callous
their ears are dull of hearing
their eyes they have closed
lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and i would heal them
be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of god is sent to the nations
they will also listen
when he had said these words, the jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves
paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,
preaching the kingdom of god, and teaching the things concerning the lord jesus christ with all boldness, without hindrance
paul, a servant of jesus christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the good news of god,
which he promised before through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
concerning his son, who was born of the seed of david according to the flesh,
who was declared to be the son of god with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, jesus christ our lord,
through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his names sake;
among whom you are also called to belong to jesus christ;
to all who are in rome, beloved of god, called to be saints
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
first, i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world
for god is my witness, whom i serve in my spirit in the good news of his son, how unceasingly i make mention of you always in my prayers,
requesting, if by any means now at last i may be prospered by the will of god to come to you
for i long to see you, that i may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;
that is, that i with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the others faith, both yours and mine
now i dont desire to have you unaware, brothers, that i often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that i might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the gentiles
i am debtor both to greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish
so, as much as is in me, i am eager to preach the good news to you also who are in rome
for i am not ashamed of the good news of christ, for it is the power of god for salvation for everyone who believes; for the jew first, and also for the greek
for in it is revealed gods righteousness from faith to faith
as it is written, but the righteous shall live by faith
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
because that which is known of god is revealed in them, for god revealed it to them
for the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse
because, knowing god, they didnt glorify him as god, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened
professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
and traded the glory of the incorruptible god for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things
therefore god also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,
who exchanged the truth of god for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever
amen
for this reason, god gave them up to vile passions
for their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature
likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error
even as they refused to have god in their knowledge, god gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,
backbiters, hateful to god, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;
who, knowing the ordinance of god, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them
therefore you are without excuse, o man, whoever you are who judge
for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself
for you who judge practice the same things
we know that the judgment of god is according to truth against those who practice such things
do you think this, o man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of god?
or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of god leads you to repentance?
but according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of god;
who will pay back to everyone according to their works
to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;
but to those who are self-seeking, and dont obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,
oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the jew first, and also to the greek
but glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the jew first, and also to the greek
for there is no partiality with god
for as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law
as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law
for it isnt the hearers of the law who are righteous before god, but the doers of the law will be justified
(for when gentiles who dont have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,
in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)
in the day when god will judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, by jesus christ
indeed you bear the name of a jew, and rest on the law, and glory in god,
and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth
you therefore who teach another, dont you teach yourself? you who preach that a man shouldnt steal, do you steal?
you who say a man shouldnt commit adultery
do you commit adultery? you who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
you who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor god?
for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you, just as it is written
for circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision
if therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, wont his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?
wont the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?
for he is not a jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;
but he is a jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from god
then what advantage does the jew have? or what is the profit of circumcision?
much in every way! because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of god
for what if some were without faith? will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of god?
may it never be! yes, let god be found true, but every man a liar
as it is written, that you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment
but if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of god, what will we say? is god unrighteous who inflicts wrath? i speak like men do
may it never be! for then how will god judge the world?
for if the truth of god through my lie abounded to his glory, why am i also still judged as a sinner?
why not, let us do evil, that good may come? those who say so are justly condemned
what then? are we better than they? no, in no way
for we previously warned both jews and greeks, that they are all under sin
as it is written, there is no one righteous; no, not one
there is no one who understands
there is no one who seeks after god
they have all turned aside
they have together become unprofitable
there is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one
their throat is an open tomb
with their tongues they have used deceit
the poison of vipers is under their lips;
whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
their feet are swift to shed blood
destruction and misery are in their ways
the way of peace, they havent known
there is no fear of god before their eyes
now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of god
because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight
for through the law comes the knowledge of sin
but now apart from the law, a righteousness of god has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;
even the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ to all and on all those who believe
for there is no distinction,
for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of god;
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus;
whom god set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in gods forbearance;
to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in jesus
where then is the boasting? it is excluded
by what kind of law? of works? no, but by a law of faith
we maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law
or is god the god of jews only? isnt he the god of gentiles also? yes, of gentiles also,
since indeed there is one god who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith
do we then nullify the law through faith? may it never be! no, we establish the law
what then will we say that abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?
for if abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward god
for what does the scripture say? abraham believed god, and it was accounted to him for righteousness
now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as something owed
but to him who doesnt work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness
even as david also pronounces blessing on the man to whom god counts righteousness apart from works,
blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered
blessed is the man whom the lord will by no means charge with sin
is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? for we say that faith was accounted to abraham for righteousness
how then was it counted? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision
he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they might be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them
he is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham, which he had in uncircumcision
for the promise to abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasnt through the law, but through the righteousness of faith
for if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect
for the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience
for this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of abraham, who is the father of us all
as it is written, i have made you a father of many nations
this is in the presence of him whom he believed
god, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were
who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, so will your seed be
without being weakened in faith, he didnt consider his own body, already having been worn out,, and the deadness of sarahs womb
yet, looking to the promise of god, he didnt waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to god,
and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was also able to perform
therefore it also was reckoned to him for righteousness
now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,
but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised jesus, our lord, from the dead,
who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification
being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ;
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand
we rejoice in hope of the glory of god
not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;
and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope
and hope doesnt disappoint us, because gods love has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit who was given to us
for while we were yet weak, at the right time christ died for the ungodly
for one will hardly die for a righteous man
yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die
but god commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, christ died for us
much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from gods wrath through him
for if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to god through the death of his son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life
not only so, but we also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation
therefore as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned
for until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law
nevertheless death reigned from adam until moses, even over those whose sins werent like adams disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come
but the free gift isnt like the trespass
for if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of god, and the gift by the grace of the one man, jesus christ, abound to the many
the gift is not as through one who sinned
for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification
for if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, jesus christ
so then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life
for as through the one mans disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous
the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;
that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through jesus christ our lord
what shall we say then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
may it never be! we who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?
or dont you know that all we who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death?
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father, so we also might walk in newness of life
for if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;
knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin
for he who has died has been freed from sin
but if we died with christ, we believe that we will also live with him;
knowing that christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more
death no more has dominion over him!
for the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to god
thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to god in christ jesus our lord
therefore dont let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts
neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to god, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to god
for sin will not have dominion over you
for you are not under law, but under grace
what then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? may it never be!
dont you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
but thanks be to god, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered
being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness
i speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification
for when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death
but now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of god, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life
for the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
or dont you know, brothers, that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?
for the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband
so then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress
but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man
therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to god
for when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death
but now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter
what shall we say then? is the law sin? may it never be! however, i wouldnt have known sin, except through the law
for i wouldnt have known coveting, unless the law had said, you shall not covet
but sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting
for apart from the law, sin is dead
i was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and i died
the commandment, which was for life, this i found to be for death;
for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me
therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good
did then that which is good become death to me? may it never be! but sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful
for we know that the law is spiritual, but i am fleshly, sold under sin
for i dont know what i am doing
for i dont practice what i desire to do; but what i hate, that i do
but if what i dont desire, that i do, i consent to the law that it is good
so now it is no more i that do it, but sin which dwells in me
for i know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing
for desire is present with me, but i dont find it doing that which is good
for the good which i desire, i dont do; but the evil which i dont desire, that i practice
but if what i dont desire, that i do, it is no more i that do it, but sin which dwells in me
i find then the law, that, to me, while i desire to do good, evil is present
for i delight in gods law after the inward man,
but i see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members
what a wretched man i am! who will deliver me out of the body of this death?
i thank god through jesus christ, our lord! so then with the mind, i myself serve gods law, but with the flesh, the sins law
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in christ jesus, who dont walk according to the flesh, but according to the spirit
for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death
for what the law couldnt do, in that it was weak through the flesh, god did, sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;
that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit
for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the spirit, the things of the spirit
for the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the spirit is life and peace;
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards god; for it is not subject to gods law, neither indeed can it be
those who are in the flesh cant please god
but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if it is so that the spirit of god dwells in you
but if any man doesnt have the spirit of christ, he is not his
if christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness
but if the spirit of him who raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up christ jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who dwells in you
so then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh
for if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live
for as many as are led by the spirit of god, these are children of god
for you didnt receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, abba ! father!
the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of god;
and if children, then heirs; heirs of god, and joint heirs with christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him
for i consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us
for the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of god to be revealed
for the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope
that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of god
for we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now
not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body
for we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope
for who hopes for that which he sees?
but if we hope for that which we dont see, we wait for it with patience
in the same way, the spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we dont know how to pray as we ought
but the spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cant be uttered
he who searches the hearts knows what is on the spirits mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to god
we know that all things work together for good for those who love god, to those who are called according to his purpose
for whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers
whom he predestined, those he also called
whom he called, those he also justified
whom he justified, those he also glorified
what then shall we say about these things? if god is for us, who can be against us?
he who didnt spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?
who could bring a charge against gods chosen ones? it is god who justifies
who is he who condemns? it is christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of god, who also makes intercession for us
who shall separate us from the love of christ? could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
even as it is written, for your sake we are killed all day long
we were accounted as sheep for the slaughter
no, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us
for i am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of god, which is in christ jesus our lord
i tell the truth in christ
i am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the holy spirit,
that i have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart
for i could wish that i myself were accursed from christ for my brothers sake, my relatives according to the flesh,
who are israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;
of whom are the fathers, and from whom is christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, god, blessed forever
amen
but it is not as though the word of god has come to nothing
for they are not all israel, that are of israel
neither, because they are abrahams seed, are they all children
but, in isaac will your seed be called
that is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of god, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed
for this is a word of promise, at the appointed time i will come, and sarah will have a son
not only so, but rebecca also conceived by one, by our father isaac
for being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of god according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,
it was said to her, the elder will serve the younger
even as it is written, jacob i loved, but esau i hated
what shall we say then? is there unrighteousness with god? may it never be!
for he said to moses, i will have mercy on whom i have mercy, and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
so then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of god who has mercy
for the scripture says to pharaoh, for this very purpose i caused you to be raised up, that i might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth
so then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires
you will say then to me, why does he still find fault? for who withstands his will?
but indeed, o man, who are you to reply against god? will the thing formed ask him who formed it, why did you make me like this?
or hasnt the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
what if god, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
us, whom he also called, not from the jews only, but also from the gentiles?
as he says also in hosea, i will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, who was not beloved
it will be that in the place where it was said to them, you are not my people, there they will be called children of the living god
isaiah cries concerning israel, if the number of the children of israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;
for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the lord will make a short work upon the earth
as isaiah has said before, unless the lord of armies had left us a seed, we would have become like sodom, and would have been made like gomorrah
what shall we say then? that the gentiles, who didnt follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;
but israel, following after a law of righteousness, didnt arrive at the law of righteousness
why? because they didnt seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law
they stumbled over the stumbling stone;
even as it is written, behold, i lay in zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed
brothers, my hearts desire and my prayer to god is for israel, that they may be saved
for i testify about them that they have a zeal for god, but not according to knowledge
for being ignorant of gods righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didnt subject themselves to the righteousness of god
for christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes
for moses writes about the righteousness of the law, the one who does them will live by them
but the righteousness which is of faith says this, dont say in your heart, who will ascend into heaven? ;
or, who will descend into the abyss? 
but what does it say? the word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart; that is, the word of faith, which we preach
that if you will confess with your mouth that jesus is lord, and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, you will be saved
for with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
for the scripture says, whoever believes in him will not be disappointed
for there is no distinction between jew and greek; for the same lord is lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him
for, whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? how will they hear without a preacher?
and how will they preach unless they are sent? as it is written
how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!
but they didnt all listen to the glad news
for isaiah says, lord, who has believed our report?
so faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of god
but i say, didnt they hear? yes, most certainly, their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world
but i ask, didnt israel know? first moses says, i will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding i will make you angry
isaiah is very bold, and says, i was found by those who didnt seek me
i was revealed to those who didnt ask for me
but as to israel he says, all day long i stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people
i ask then, did god reject his people? may it never be! for i also am an israelite, a descendant of abraham, of the tribe of benjamin
god didnt reject his people, which he foreknew
or dont you know what the scripture says about elijah? how he pleads with god against israel
lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and i am left alone, and they seek my life
but how does god answer him? i have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to baal
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
and if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace
but if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work
what then? that which israel seeks for, that he didnt obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened
according as it is written, god gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day
david says, let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them
let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see
bow down their back always
i ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? may it never be! but by their fall salvation has come to the gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy
now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the gentiles; how much more their fullness?
for i speak to you who are gentiles
since then as i am an apostle to gentiles, i glorify my ministry;
if by any means i may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them
for if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?
if the first fruit is holy, so is the lump
if the root is holy, so are the branches
but if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;
dont boast over the branches
but if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you
you will say then, branches were broken off, that i might be grafted in
true; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith
dont be conceited, but fear;
for if god didnt spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you
see then the goodness and severity of god
toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off
they also, if they dont continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for god is able to graft them in again
for if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
for i dont desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you wont be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to israel, until the fullness of the gentiles has come in,
and so all israel will be saved
even as it is written, there will come out of zion the deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from jacob
this is my covenant to them, when i will take away their sins
concerning the good news, they are enemies for your sake
but concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers sake
for the gifts and the calling of god are irrevocable
for as you in time past were disobedient to god, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy
for god has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all
oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of god! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!
for who has known the mind of the lord? or who has been his counselor?
or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?
for of him, and through him, and to him, are all things
to him be the glory for ever! amen
therefore i urge you, brothers, by the mercies of god, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to god, which is your spiritual service
dont be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of god
for i say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as god has apportioned to each person a measure of faith
for even as we have many members in one body, and all the members dont have the same function,
so we, who are many, are one body in christ, and individually members one of another
having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;
or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;
or he who exhorts, to his exhorting
he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness
let love be without hypocrisy
abhor that which is evil
cling to that which is good
in love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;
not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the lord;
rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;
contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality
bless those who persecute you; bless, and dont curse
rejoice with those who rejoice
weep with those who weep
be of the same mind one toward another
dont set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble
dont be wise in your own conceits
repay no one evil for evil
respect what is honorable in the sight of all men
if it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men
dont seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to gods wrath
for it is written, vengeance belongs to me; i will repay, says the lord
therefore if your enemy is hungry, feed him
if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head
dont be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good
let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from god, and those who exist are ordained by god
therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of god; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment
for rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil
do you desire to have no fear of the authority? do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,
for he is a servant of god to you for good
but if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesnt bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of god, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil
therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience sake
for this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of gods service, attending continually on this very thing
give therefore to everyone what you owe
taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor
owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law
for the commandments, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not covet, and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, you shall love your neighbor as yourself
love doesnt harm a neighbor
love therefore is the fulfillment of the law
do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed
the night is far gone, and the day is near
lets therefore throw off the works of darkness, and lets put on the armor of light
let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy
but put on the lord jesus christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts
now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions
one man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables
dont let him who eats despise him who doesnt eat
dont let him who doesnt eat judge him who eats, for god has accepted him
who are you who judge anothers servant? to his own lord he stands or falls
yes, he will be made to stand, for god has power to make him stand
one man esteems one day as more important
another esteems every day alike
let each man be fully assured in his own mind
he who observes the day, observes it to the lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the lord he does not observe it
he who eats, eats to the lord, for he gives god thanks
he who doesnt eat, to the lord he doesnt eat, and gives god thanks
for none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself
for if we live, we live to the lord
or if we die, we die to the lord
if therefore we live or die, we are the lords
for to this end christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be lord of both the dead and the living
but you, why do you judge your brother? or you again, why do you despise your brother? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of christ
for it is written, as i live, says the lord, to me every knee will bow
every tongue will confess to god
so then each one of us will give account of himself to god
therefore lets not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brothers way, or an occasion for falling
i know, and am persuaded in the lord jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean
yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love
dont destroy with your food him for whom christ died
then dont let your good be slandered,
for the kingdom of god is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy spirit
for he who serves christ in these things is acceptable to god and approved by men
so then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up
dont overthrow gods work for foods sake
all things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating
it is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, is offended, or is made weak
do you have faith? have it to yourself before god
happy is he who doesnt judge himself in that which he approves
but he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isnt of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin
now to him who is able to establish you according to my good news and the preaching of jesus christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages,  but now is revealed, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal god, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations;  to the only wise god, through jesus christ, to whom be the glory forever! amen
now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves
let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up
for even christ didnt please himself
but, as it is written, the reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me
for whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope
now the god of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to christ jesus,
that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ
therefore accept one another, even as christ also accepted you, to the glory of god
now i say that christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of god, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,
and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy
as it is written, therefore will i give praise to you among the gentiles, and sing to your name
again he says, rejoice, you gentiles, with his people
again, praise the lord, all you gentiles! let all the peoples praise him
again, isaiah says, there will be the root of jesse, he who arises to rule over the gentiles; in him the gentiles will hope
now may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the holy spirit
i myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others
but i write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by god,
that i should be a servant of christ jesus to the gentiles, serving as a priest the good news of god, that the offering up of the gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the holy spirit
i have therefore my boasting in christ jesus in things pertaining to god
for i will not dare to speak of any things except those which christ worked through me, for the obedience of the gentiles, by word and deed,
in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of gods spirit; so that from jerusalem, and around as far as to illyricum, i have fully preached the good news of christ;
yes, making it my aim to preach the good news, not where christ was already named, that i might not build on anothers foundation
but, as it is written, they will see, to whom no news of him came
they who havent heard will understand
therefore also i was hindered these many times from coming to you,
but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,
whenever i journey to spain, i will come to you
for i hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first i may enjoy your company for a while
but now, i say, i am going to jerusalem, serving the saints
for it has been the good pleasure of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at jerusalem
yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors
for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things
when therefore i have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, i will go on by way of you to spain
i know that, when i come to you, i will come in the fullness of the blessing of the good news of christ
now i beg you, brothers, by our lord jesus christ, and by the love of the spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to god for me,
that i may be delivered from those who are disobedient in judea, and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
that i may come to you in joy through the will of god, and together with you, find rest
now the god of peace be with you all
amen
i commend to you phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the assembly that is at cenchreae,
that you receive her in the lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self
greet prisca and aquila, my fellow workers in christ jesus,
who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only i give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the gentiles
greet the assembly that is in their house
greet epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of achaia to christ
greet mary, who labored much for us
greet andronicus and junia, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who also were in christ before me
greet amplias, my beloved in the lord
greet urbanus, our fellow worker in christ, and stachys, my beloved
greet apelles, the approved in christ
greet those who are of the household of aristobulus
greet herodion, my kinsman
greet them of the household of narcissus, who are in the lord
greet tryphaena and tryphosa, who labor in the lord
greet persis, the beloved, who labored much in the lord
greet rufus, the chosen in the lord, and his mother and mine
greet asyncritus, phlegon, hermes, patrobas, hermas, and the brothers who are with them
greet philologus and julia, nereus and his sister, and olympas, and all the saints who are with them
greet one another with a holy kiss
the assemblies of christ greet you
now i beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them
for those who are such dont serve our lord, jesus christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent
for your obedience has become known to all
i rejoice therefore over you
but i desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil
and the god of peace will quickly crush satan under your feet
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do lucius, jason, and sosipater, my relatives
i, tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the lord
gaius, my host and host of the whole assembly, greets you
erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as does quartus, the brother
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all! amen
paul, called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god, and our brother sosthenes,
to the assembly of god which is at corinth; those who are sanctified in christ jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our lord jesus christ in every place, both theirs and ours
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
i always thank my god concerning you, for the grace of god which was given you in christ jesus;
that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;
even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you
so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our lord jesus christ;
who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ
god is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his son, jesus christ, our lord
now i beg you, brothers, through the name of our lord, jesus christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment
for it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from chloes household, that there are contentions among you
now i mean this, that each one of you says, i follow paul, i follow apollos, i follow cephas, and, i follow christ
is christ divided? was paul crucified for you? or were you baptized into the name of paul?
i thank god that i baptized none of you, except crispus and gaius,
so that no one should say that i had baptized you into my own name

for christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the good news--not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of christ wouldnt be made void
for the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of god
for it is written, i will destroy the wisdom of the wise, i will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing
where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the lawyer of this world? hasnt god made foolish the wisdom of this world?
for seeing that in the wisdom of god, the world through its wisdom didnt know god, it was gods good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe
for jews ask for signs, greeks seek after wisdom,
but we preach christ crucified; a stumbling block to jews, and foolishness to greeks,
but to those who are called, both jews and greeks, christ is the power of god and the wisdom of god
because the foolishness of god is wiser than men, and the weakness of god is stronger than men
for you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;
but god chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise
god chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;
and god chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are
that no flesh should boast before god
but of him, you are in christ jesus, who was made to us wisdom from god, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption
that, according as it is written, he who boasts, let him boast in the lord
when i came to you, brothers, i didnt come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of god
for i determined not to know anything among you, except jesus christ, and him crucified
i was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling
my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power,
that your faith wouldnt stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of god
we speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing
but we speak gods wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which god foreordained before the worlds for our glory,
which none of the rulers of this world has known
for had they known it, they wouldnt have crucified the lord of glory
but as it is written, things which an eye didnt see, and an ear didnt hear, which didnt enter into the heart of man, these god has prepared for those who love him
but to us, god revealed them through the spirit
for the spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of god
for who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so, no one knows the things of god, except gods spirit
but we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from god, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by god
which things also we speak, not in words which mans wisdom teaches, but which the holy spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things
now the natural man doesnt receive the things of gods spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he cant know them, because they are spiritually discerned
but he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one
for who has known the mind of the lord, that he should instruct him? but we have christs mind
brothers, i couldnt speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in christ
i fed you with milk, not with meat; for you werent yet ready
indeed, not even now are you ready,
for you are still fleshly
for insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, arent you fleshly, and dont you walk in the ways of men?
for when one says, i follow paul, and another, i follow apollos, arent you fleshly?
who then is apollos, and who is paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the lord gave to him?
i planted
apollos watered
but god gave the increase
so then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but god who gives the increase
now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor
for we are gods fellow workers
you are gods farming, gods building
according to the grace of god which was given to me, as a wise master builder i laid a foundation, and another builds on it
but let each man be careful how he builds on it
for no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is jesus christ
but if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;
each mans work will be revealed
for the day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each mans work is
if any mans work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward
if any mans work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire
dont you know that you are a temple of god, and that gods spirit lives in you?
if anyone destroys the temple of god, god will destroy him; for gods temple is holy, which you are
let no one deceive himself
if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god
for it is written, he has taken the wise in their craftiness
and again, the lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless
therefore let no one boast in men
for all things are yours,
whether paul, or apollos, or cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come
all are yours,
and you are christs, and christ is gods
so let a man think of us as christs servants, and stewards of gods mysteries
here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful
but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged by you, or by mans judgment
yes, i dont judge my own self
for i know nothing against myself
yet i am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the lord
therefore judge nothing before the time, until the lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts
then each man will get his praise from god
now these things, brothers, i have in a figure transferred to myself and apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another
for who makes you different? and what do you have that you didnt receive? but if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
you are already filled
you have already become rich
you have come to reign without us
yes, and i wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you
for, i think that god has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death
for we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men
we are fools for christs sake, but you are wise in christ
we are weak, but you are strong
you have honor, but we have dishonor
even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place
we toil, working with our own hands
when people curse us, we bless
being persecuted, we endure
being defamed, we entreat
we are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now
i dont write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children
for though you have ten thousand tutors in christ, yet not many fathers
for in christ jesus, i became your father through the good news
i beg you therefore, be imitators of me
because of this i have sent timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in christ, even as i teach everywhere in every assembly
now some are puffed up, as though i were not coming to you
but i will come to you shortly, if the lord is willing
and i will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power
for the kingdom of god is not in word, but in power
what do you want? shall i come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the gentiles, that one has his fathers wife
you are puffed up, and didnt rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you
for i most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though i were present, judged him who has done this thing
in the name of our lord jesus christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our lord jesus christ,
are to deliver such a one to satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
your boasting is not good
dont you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?
purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened
for indeed christ, our passover, has been sacrificed in our place
therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
i wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world
but as it is, i wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner
dont even eat with such a person
for what have i to do with also judging those who are outside? dont you judge those who are within?
but those who are outside, god judges
put away the wicked man from among yourselves
dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
dont you know that the saints will judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
dont you know that we will judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?
if then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?
i say this to move you to shame
isnt there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?
but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!
therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another
why not rather be wronged? why not rather be defrauded?
no, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers
or dont you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god? dont be deceived
neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the kingdom of god
such were some of you, but you were washed
but you were sanctified
but you were justified in the name of the lord jesus, and in the spirit of our god
all things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient
all things are lawful for me, but i will not be brought under the power of anything
foods for the belly, and the belly for foods, but god will bring to nothing both it and them
but the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the lord; and the lord for the body
now god raised up the lord, and will also raise us up by his power
dont you know that your bodies are members of christ? shall i then take the members of christ, and make them members of a prostitute? may it never be!
or dont you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? for, the two, says he, will become one flesh
but he who is joined to the lord is one spirit
flee sexual immorality! every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body
or dont you know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit which is in you, which you have from god? you are not your own,
for you were bought with a price
therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit, which are gods
now concerning the things about which you wrote to me
it is good for a man not to touch a woman
but, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband
let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband
the wife doesnt have authority over her own body, but the husband
likewise also the husband doesnt have authority over his own body, but the wife
dont deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that satan doesnt tempt you because of your lack of self-control
but this i say by way of concession, not of commandment
yet i wish that all men were like me
however each man has his own gift from god, one of this kind, and another of that kind
but i say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as i am
but if they dont have self-control, let them marry
for its better to marry than to burn
but to the married i command--not i, but the lord--that the wife not leave her husband
, and that the husband not leave his wife
but to the rest i--not the lord--say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her
the woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband
otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy
yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation
the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but god has called us in peace
for how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
only, as the lord has distributed to each man, as god has called each, so let him walk
so i command in all the assemblies
was anyone called having been circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised
has anyone been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised
circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of god
let each man stay in that calling in which he was called
were you called being a bondservant? dont let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it
for he who was called in the lord being a bondservant is the lords free man
likewise he who was called being free is christs bondservant
you were bought with a price
dont become bondservants of men
brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with god
now concerning virgins, i have no commandment from the lord, but i give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the lord to be trustworthy
i think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is
are you bound to a wife? dont seek to be freed
are you free from a wife? dont seek a wife
but if you marry, you have not sinned
if a virgin marries, she has not sinned
yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and i want to spare you
but i say this, brothers
the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;
and those who weep, as though they didnt weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didnt rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didnt possess;
and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest
for the mode of this world passes away
but i desire to have you to be free from cares
he who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the lord, how he may please the lord;
but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife
there is also a difference between a wife and a virgin
the unmarried woman cares about the things of the lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit
but she who is married cares about the things of the world--how she may please her husband
this i say for your own profit; not that i may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the lord without distraction
but if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires
he doesnt sin
let them marry
but he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well
so then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesnt give her in marriage does better
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the lord
but she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and i think that i also have gods spirit
now concerning things sacrificed to idols
we know that we all have knowledge
knowledge puffs up, but love builds up
but if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesnt yet know as he ought to know
but if anyone loves god, the same is known by him
therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other god but one
for though there are things that are called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many gods and many lords;
yet to us there is one god, the father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one lord, jesus christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him
however, that knowledge isnt in all men
but some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled
but food will not commend us to god
for neither, if we dont eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better
but be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak
for if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idols temple, wont his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
and through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake christ died
thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against christ
therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, i will eat no meat forevermore, that i dont cause my brother to stumble
am i not free? am i not an apostle? havent i seen jesus christ, our lord? arent you my work in the lord?
if to others i am not an apostle, yet at least i am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord
my defense to those who examine me is this
have we no right to eat and to drink?
have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the lord, and cephas?
or have only barnabas and i no right to not work?
what soldier ever serves at his own expense? who plants a vineyard, and doesnt eat of its fruit? or who feeds a flock, and doesnt drink from the flocks milk?
do i speak these things according to the ways of men? or doesnt the law also say the same thing?
for it is written in the law of moses, you shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain
is it for the oxen that god cares,
or does he say it assuredly for our sake? yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope
if we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?
if others partake of this right over you, dont we yet more? nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the good news of christ
dont you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?
even so the lord ordained that those who proclaim the good news should live from the good news
but i have used none of these things, and i dont write these things that it may be done so in my case; for i would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void
for if i preach the good news, i have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if i dont preach the good news
for if i do this of my own will, i have a reward
but if not of my own will, i have a stewardship entrusted to me
what then is my reward? that, when i preach the good news, i may present the good news of christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the good news
for though i was free from all, i brought myself under bondage to all, that i might gain the more
to the jews i became as a jew, that i might gain jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that i might gain those who are under the law;
to those who are without law, as without law, that i might win those who are without law
to the weak i became as weak, that i might gain the weak
i have become all things to all men, that i may by all means save some
now i do this for the sake of the good news, that i may be a joint partaker of it
dont you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? run like that, that you may win
every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things
now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible
i therefore run like that, as not uncertainly
i fight like that, as not beating the air,
but i beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after i have preached to others, i myself should be rejected
now i would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
and were all baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea;
and all ate the same spiritual food;
and all drank the same spiritual drink
for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was christ
however with most of them, god was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness
now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted
neither be idolaters, as some of them were
as it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play
neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell
neither let us test the lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents
neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer
now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come
therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesnt fall
no temptation has taken you except what is common to man
god is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it
therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry
i speak as to wise men
judge what i say
the cup of blessing which we bless, isnt it a sharing of the blood of christ? the bread which we break, isnt it a sharing of the body of christ?
because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread
consider israel according to the flesh
dont those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
what am i saying then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to god, and i dont desire that you would have fellowship with demons
you cant both drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons
you cant both partake of the table of the lord, and of the table of demons
or do we provoke the lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
all things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable
all things are lawful for me, but not all things build up
let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbors good
whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,
for the earth is the lords, and its fullness
but if one of those who dont believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience
but if anyone says to you, this was offered to idols, dont eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience
for the earth is the lords, and all its fullness
conscience, i say, not your own, but the others conscience
for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?
if i partake with thankfulness, why am i denounced for that for which i give thanks?
whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of god
give no occasions for stumbling, either to jews, or to greeks, or to the assembly of god;
even as i also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved
be imitators of me, even as i also am of christ
now i praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as i delivered them to you
but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of christ is god
every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head
but every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head
for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved
for if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn
but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of god, but the woman is the glory of the man
for man is not from woman, but woman from man;
for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man
for this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels
nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the lord
for as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from god
judge for yourselves
is it appropriate that a woman pray to god unveiled?
doesnt even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering
but if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do gods assemblies
but in giving you this command, i dont praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse
for first of all, when you come together in the assembly, i hear that divisions exist among you, and i partly believe it
for there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you
when therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the lords supper that you eat
for in your eating each one takes his own supper first
one is hungry, and another is drunken
what, dont you have houses to eat and to drink in? or do you despise gods assembly, and put them to shame who dont have? what shall i tell you? shall i praise you? in this i dont praise you
for i received from the lord that which also i delivered to you, that the lord jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread
when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, take, eat
this is my body, which is broken for you
do this in memory of me
in the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood
do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me
for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the lords death until he comes
therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the lords cup in a way unworthy of the lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord
but let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesnt discern the lords body
for this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep
for if we discerned ourselves, we wouldnt be judged
but when we are judged, we are punished by the lord, that we may not be condemned with the world
therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another
but if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment
the rest i will set in order whenever i come
now concerning spiritual things, brothers, i dont want you to be ignorant
you know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led
therefore i make known to you that no man speaking by gods spirit says, jesus is accursed
no one can say, jesus is lord, but by the holy spirit
now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same spirit
there are various kinds of service, and the same lord
there are various kinds of workings, but the same god, who works all things in all
but to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the profit of all
for to one is given through the spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same spirit;
to another faith, by the same spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same spirit;
and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages
but the one and the same spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires
for as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is christ
for in one spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether jews or greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one spirit
for the body is not one member, but many
if the foot would say, because im not the hand, im not part of the body, it is not therefore not part of the body
if the ear would say, because im not the eye, im not part of the body, its not therefore not part of the body
if the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? if the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?
but now god has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired
if they were all one member, where would the body be?
but now they are many members, but one body
the eye cant tell the hand, i have no need for you, or again the head to the feet, i have no need for you
no, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary
those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;
whereas our presentable parts have no such need
but god composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,
that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another
when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it
or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it
now you are the body of christ, and members individually
god has set some in the assembly
first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages
are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all miracle workers?
do all have gifts of healings? do all speak with various languages? do all interpret?
but earnestly desire the best gifts
moreover, i show a most excellent way to you
if i speak with the languages of men and of angels, but dont have love, i have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal
if i have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if i have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but dont have love, i am nothing
if i dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if i give my body to be burned, but dont have love, it profits me nothing
love is patient and is kind; love doesnt envy
love doesnt brag, is not proud,
doesnt behave itself inappropriately, doesnt seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;
doesnt rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things
love never fails
but where there are prophecies, they will be done away with
where there are various languages, they will cease
where there is knowledge, it will be done away with
for we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with
when i was a child, i spoke as a child, i felt as a child, i thought as a child
now that i have become a man, i have put away childish things
for now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face
now i know in part, but then i will know fully, even as i was also fully known
but now faith, hope, and love remain--these three
the greatest of these is love
follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy
for he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to god; for no one understands; but in the spirit he speaks mysteries
but he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation
he who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly
now i desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy
for he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up
but now, brothers, if i come to you speaking with other languages, what would i profit you, unless i speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didnt give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?
for if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?
so also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? for you would be speaking into the air
there are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning
if then i dont know the meaning of the sound, i would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me
so also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly
therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret
for if i pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful
what is it then? i will pray with the spirit, and i will pray with the understanding also
i will sing with the spirit, and i will sing with the understanding also
otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesnt know what you say?
for you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up
i thank my god, i speak with other languages more than you all
however in the assembly i would rather speak five words with my understanding, that i might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language
brothers, dont be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature
in the law it is written, by men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers i will speak to this people
not even thus will they hear me, says the lord
therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe
if therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, wont they say that you are crazy?
but if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all
and thus the secrets of his heart are revealed
so he will fall down on his face and worship god, declaring that god is among you indeed
what is it then, brothers? when you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation
let all things be done to build each other up
if any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret
but if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to god
let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern
but if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent
for you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted
the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,
for god is not a god of confusion, but of peace
as in all the assemblies of the saints,
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says
if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly
what? was it from you that the word of god went out? or did it come to you alone?
if any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which i write to you, that they are the commandment of the lord
but if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant
therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and dont forbid speaking with other languages
let all things be done decently and in order
now i declare to you, brothers, the good news which i preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,
by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which i preached to you--unless you believed in vain
for i delivered to you first of all that which i also received
that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,
that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures,
and that he appeared to cephas, then to the twelve
then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep
then he appeared to james, then to all the apostles,
and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also
for i am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because i persecuted the assembly of god
but by the grace of god i am what i am
his grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but i worked more than all of them; yet not i, but the grace of god which was with me
whether then it is i or they, so we preach, and so you believed
now if christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
but if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has christ been raised
if christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain
yes, we are found false witnesses of god, because we testified about god that he raised up christ, whom he didnt raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised
for if the dead arent raised, neither has christ been raised
if christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins
then they also who are fallen asleep in christ have perished
if we have only hoped in christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable
but now christ has been raised from the dead
he became the first fruits of those who are asleep
for since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man
for as in adam all die, so also in christ all will be made alive
but each in his own order
christ the first fruits, then those who are christs, at his coming
then the end comes, when he will deliver up the kingdom to god, even the father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power
for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet
the last enemy that will be abolished is death
for, he put all things in subjection under his feet
but when he says, all things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him
when all things have been subjected to him, then the son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that god may be all in all
or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? if the dead arent raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?
why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
i affirm, by the boasting in you which i have in christ jesus our lord, i die daily
if i fought with animals at ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? if the dead are not raised, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die
dont be deceived! evil companionships corrupt good morals
wake up righteously, and dont sin, for some have no knowledge of god
i say this to your shame
but someone will say, how are the dead raised? and, with what kind of body do they come?
you foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies
that which you sow, you dont sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind
but god gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own
all flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds
there are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial
there is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory
so also is the resurrection of the dead
it is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption
it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory
it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power
it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body
there is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body
so also it is written, the first man, adam, became a living soul
the last adam became a life-giving spirit
however that which is spiritual isnt first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual
the first man is of the earth, made of dust
the second man is the lord from heaven
as is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly
as we have borne the image of those made of dust, lets also bear the image of the heavenly
now i say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cant inherit the kingdom of god; neither does corruption inherit incorruption
behold, i tell you a mystery
we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet
for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed
for this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality
but when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen
death is swallowed up in victory
death, where is your sting? hades, where is your victory?
the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law
but thanks be to god, who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ
therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the lords work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord
now concerning the collection for the saints, as i commanded the assemblies of galatia, you do likewise
on the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when i come
when i arrive, i will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to jerusalem
if it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me
but i will come to you when i have passed through macedonia, for i am passing through macedonia
but with you it may be that i will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever i go
for i do not wish to see you now in passing, but i hope to stay a while with you, if the lord permits
but i will stay at ephesus until pentecost,
for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries
now if timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the lord, as i also do
therefore let no one despise him
but set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for i expect him with the brothers
now concerning apollos, the brother, i strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity
watch! stand firm in the faith! be courageous! be strong!
let all that you do be done in love
now i beg you, brothers,
that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors
i rejoice at the coming of stephanas, fortunatus, and achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied
for they refreshed my spirit and yours
therefore acknowledge those who are like that
the assemblies of asia greet you
aquila and priscilla greet you much in the lord, together with the assembly that is in their house
all the brothers greet you
greet one another with a holy kiss
this greeting is by me, paul, with my own hand
if any man doesnt love the lord jesus christ, let him be accursed 
come, lord!
the grace of the lord jesus christ be with you
my love to all of you in christ jesus
amen
paul, an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god, and timothy our brother, to the assembly of god which is at corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of achaia
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ, the father of mercies and god of all comfort;
who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by god
for as the sufferings of christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through christ
but if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation
if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer
our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort
for we dont desire to have you uninformed, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened to us in asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life
yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in god who raises the dead,
who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;
you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf
for our boasting is this
the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of god, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of god we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you
for we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and i hope you will acknowledge to the end;
as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our lord jesus
in this confidence, i was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;
and by you to pass into macedonia, and again from macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to judea
when i therefore was thus determined, did i show fickleness? or the things that i purpose, do i purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yes, yes and the no, no?
but as god is faithful, our word toward you was not yes and no
for the son of god, jesus christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, silvanus, and timothy, was not yes and no, but in him is yes
for however many are the promises of god, in him is the yes
therefore also through him is the amen, to the glory of god through us
now he who establishes us with you in christ, and anointed us, is god;
who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the spirit in our hearts
but i call god for a witness to my soul, that i didnt come to corinth to spare you
not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy
for you stand firm in faith
but i determined this for myself, that i would not come to you again in sorrow
for if i make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?
and i wrote this very thing to you, so that, when i came, i wouldnt have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that i have so abundantly for you
but if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part  to you all
sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;
so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow
therefore i beg you to confirm your love toward him
for to this end i also wrote, that i might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things
now i also forgive whomever you forgive anything
for if indeed i have forgiven anything, i have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of christ,
that no advantage may be gained over us by satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes
now when i came to troas for the good news of christ, and when a door was opened to me in the lord,
i had no relief for my spirit, because i didnt find titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, i went out into macedonia
now thanks be to god, who always leads us in triumph in christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place
for we are a sweet aroma of christ to god, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life
who is sufficient for these things?
for we are not as so many, peddling the word of god
but as of sincerity, but as of god, in the sight of god, we speak in christ
are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?
you are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
being revealed that you are a letter of christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living god; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh
such confidence we have through christ toward god;
not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from god;
who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit
for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life
but if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of israel could not look steadfastly on the face of moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away
wont service of the spirit be with much more glory?
for if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory
for most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses
for if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory
having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,
and not as moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of israel wouldnt look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away
but their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in christ it passes away
but to this day, when moses is read, a veil lies on their heart
but whenever one turns to the lord, the veil is taken away
now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is, there is liberty
but we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the lord, the spirit
therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we dont faint
but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of god deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god
even if our good news is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;
in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the good news of the glory of christ, who is the image of god, should not dawn on them
for we dont preach ourselves, but christ jesus as lord, and ourselves as your servants for jesus sake;
seeing it is god who said, light will shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
but we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of god, and not from ourselves
we are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;
pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;
always carrying in the body the putting to death of the lord jesus, that the life of jesus may also be revealed in our body
for we who live are always delivered to death for jesus sake, that the life also of jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh
so then death works in us, but life in you
but having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, i believed, and therefore i spoke
we also believe, and therefore also we speak;
knowing that he who raised the lord jesus will raise us also with jesus, and will present us with you
for all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of god
therefore we dont faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day
for our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;
while we dont look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen
for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal
for we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from god, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens
for most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;
if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked
for indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life
now he who made us for this very thing is god, who also gave to us the down payment of the spirit
therefore we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the lord;
for we walk by faith, not by sight
we are courageous, i say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the lord
therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad
knowing therefore the fear of the lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to god; and i hope that we are revealed also in your consciences
for we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart
for if we are beside ourselves, it is for god
or if we are of sober mind, it is for you
for the love of christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died
he died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again
therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on
even though we have known christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more
therefore if anyone is in christ, he is a new creation
the old things have passed away
behold, all things have become new
but all things are of god, who reconciled us to himself through jesus christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;
namely, that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation
we are therefore ambassadors on behalf of christ, as though god were entreating by us
we beg you on behalf of christ, be reconciled to god
for him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of god in vain,
for he says, at an acceptable time i listened to you, in a day of salvation i helped you
behold, now is the acceptable time
behold, now is the day of salvation
we give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,
but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of god, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,
in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the holy spirit, in sincere love,
in the word of truth, in the power of god; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things
our mouth is open to you, corinthians
our heart is enlarged
you are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections
now in return, i speak as to my children, you also be open wide
dont be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what fellowship has light with darkness?
what agreement has christ with belial? or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?
what agreement has a temple of god with idols? for you are a temple of the living god
even as god said, i will dwell in them, and walk in them; and i will be their god, and they will be my people
therefore come out from among them, and be separate, says the lord
touch no unclean thing
i will receive you
i will be to you a father
you will be to me sons and daughters, says the lord almighty
having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of god
open your hearts to us
we wronged no one
we corrupted no one
we took advantage of no one
i say this not to condemn you, for i have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together
great is my boldness of speech toward you
great is my boasting on your behalf
i am filled with comfort
i overflow with joy in all our affliction
for even when we had come into macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side
fightings were outside
fear was inside
nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, god, comforted us by the coming of titus;
and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that i rejoiced still more
for though i made you sorry with my letter, i do not regret it, though i did regret it
for i see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while
i now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance
for you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing
for godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret
but the sorrow of the world works death
for behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you
yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! in everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter
so although i wrote to you, i wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of god
therefore we have been comforted
in our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all
for if in anything i have boasted to him on your behalf, i was not disappointed
but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which i made before titus was found to be truth
his affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him
i rejoice that in everything i am confident concerning you
moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of god which has been given in the assemblies of macedonia;
how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality
for according to their power, i testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,
begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints
this was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the lord, and to us through the will of god
so we urged titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace
but as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace
i speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love
for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich
i give a judgment in this
for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing
but now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability
for if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you dont have
for this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,
but for equality
your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality
as it is written, he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack
but thanks be to god, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of titus
for he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord
we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the good news is known through all the assemblies
not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the lord himself, and to show our readiness
we are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us
having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the lord, but also in the sight of men
we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you
as for titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you
as for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of christ
therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf
it is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,
for i know your readiness, of which i boast on your behalf to them of macedonia, that achaia has been prepared for a year past
your zeal has stirred up very many of them
but i have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as i said, you may be prepared,
so that i wont by any means, if there come with me any of macedonia and find you unprepared, we  should be disappointed in this confident boasting
i thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness
remember this
he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly
he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully
let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for god loves a cheerful giver
and god is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work
as it is written, he has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor
his righteousness remains forever
now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;
you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to god
for this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to god;
seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify god for the obedience of your confession to the good news of christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;
while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of god in you
now thanks be to god for his unspeakable gift!
now i paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of christ; i who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you
yes, i beg you that i may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which i intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh
for though we walk in the flesh, we dont wage war according to the flesh;
for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before god to the throwing down of strongholds,
throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of god, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of christ;
and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full
do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? if anyone trusts in himself that he is christs, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is christs, so also we are christs
for though i should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority,  i will not be disappointed,
that i may not seem as if i desire to terrify you by my letters
for, his letters, they say, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised
let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves
but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding
but we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which god appointed to us, which reach even to you
for we dont stretch ourselves too much, as though we didnt reach to you
for we came even as far as to you with the good news of christ,
not boasting beyond proper limits in other mens labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,
so as to preach the good news even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done
but he who boasts, let him boast in the lord
for it isnt he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the lord commends
i wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me
for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy
for i married you to one husband, that i might present you as a pure virgin to christ
but i am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ
for if he who comes preaches another jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough
for i reckon that i am not at all behind the very best apostles
but though i am unskilled in speech, yet i am not unskilled in knowledge
no, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things
or did i commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because i preached to you gods good news free of charge?
i robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that i might serve you
when i was present with you and was in need, i wasnt a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from macedonia, supplied the measure of my need
in everything i kept myself from being burdensome to you, and i will continue to do so
as the truth of christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of achaia
why? because i dont love you? god knows
but what i do, that i will do, that i may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we
for such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as christs apostles
and no wonder, for even satan masquerades as an angel of light
it is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works
i say again, let no one think me foolish
but if so, yet receive me as foolish, that i also may boast a little
that which i speak, i dont speak according to the lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting
seeing that many boast after the flesh, i will also boast
for you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise
for you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face
i speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak
yet however any is bold, i am bold also
are they hebrews? so am i
are they israelites? so am i
are they the seed of abraham? so am i
are they servants of christ?  i am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often
five times from the jews i received forty stripes minus one
three times i was beaten with rods
once i was stoned
three times i suffered shipwreck
i have been a night and a day in the deep
i have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;
in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness
besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies
who is weak, and i am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and i dont burn with indignation?
if i must boast, i will boast of the things that concern my weakness
the god and father of the lord jesus christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that i dont lie
in damascus the governor under king aretas guarded the city of the damascenes desiring to arrest me
through a window i was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands
it is doubtless not profitable for me to boast
for i will come to visions and revelations of the lord
i know a man in christ, fourteen years ago, such a one caught up into the third heaven
i know such a man,
how he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter
on behalf of such a one i will boast, but on my own behalf i will not boast, except in my weaknesses
for if i would desire to boast, i will not be foolish; for i will speak the truth
but i refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me
by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that i should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of satan to torment me, that i should not be exalted excessively
concerning this thing, i begged the lord three times that it might depart from me
he has said to me, my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness
most gladly therefore i will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of christ may rest on me
therefore i take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for christs sake
for when i am weak, then am i strong
i have become foolish in boasting
you compelled me, for i ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was i inferior to the very best apostles, though i am nothing
truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that i myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong
behold, this is the third time i am ready to come to you, and i will not be a burden to you; for i seek not your possessions, but you
for the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children
i will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls
if i love you more abundantly, am i loved the less?
but be it so, i did not myself burden you
but, being crafty, i caught you with deception
did i take advantage of you by anyone of them whom i have sent to you?
i exhorted titus, and i sent the brother with him
did titus take any advantage of you? didnt we walk in the same spirit? didnt we walk in the same steps?
again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? in the sight of god we speak in christ
but all things, beloved, are for your edifying
for i am afraid that by any means, when i come, i might find you not the way i want to, and that i might be found by you as you dont desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;
that again when i come my god would humble me before you, and i would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed
this is the third time i am coming to you
at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established
i have said beforehand, and i do say beforehand, as when i was present the second time, so now, being absent, i write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if i come again, i will not spare;
seeing that you seek a proof of christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you
for he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of god
for we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of god toward you
test your own selves, whether you are in the faith
test your own selves
or dont you know as to your own selves, that jesus christ is in you?--unless indeed you are disqualified
but i hope that you will know that we arent disqualified
now i pray to god that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate
for we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth
for we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong
and this we also pray for, even your perfecting
for this cause i write these things while absent, that i may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down
finally, brothers, rejoice
be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the god of love and peace will be with you
greet one another with a holy kiss
all the saints greet you
the grace of the lord jesus christ, the love of god, and the fellowship of the holy spirit, be with you all
amen
paul, an apostle,
and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of galatia
grace to you and peace from god the father, and our lord jesus christ,
who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our god and father--
to whom be the glory forever and ever
amen
i marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of christ to a different good news;
and there isnt another good news
only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the good news of christ
but even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any good news other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed
as we have said before, so i now say again
if any man preaches to you any good news other than that which you received, let him be cursed
for am i now seeking the favor of men, or of god? or am i striving to please men? for if i were still pleasing men, i wouldnt be a servant of christ
but i make known to you, brothers, concerning the good news which was preached by me, that it is not according to man
for neither did i receive it from man, nor was i taught it, but it came to me through revelation of jesus christ
for you have heard of my way of living in time past in the jews religion, how that beyond measure i persecuted the assembly of god, and ravaged it
i advanced in the jews religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers
but when it was the good pleasure of god, who separated me from my mothers womb, and called me through his grace,
to reveal his son in me, that i might preach him among the gentiles, i didnt immediately confer with flesh and blood,
nor did i go up to jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but i went away into arabia
then i returned to damascus
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to visit peter, and stayed with him fifteen days
but of the other apostles i saw no one, except james, the lords brother
now about the things which i write to you, behold, before god, im not lying
then i came to the regions of syria and cilicia
i was still unknown by face to the assemblies of judea which were in christ,
but they only heard
he who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy
and they glorified god in me
then after a period of fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas, taking titus also with me
i went up by revelation, and i laid before them the good news which i preach among the gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that i might be running, or had run, in vain
but not even titus, who was with me, being a greek, was compelled to be circumcised
this was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;
to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the good news might continue with you
but from those who were reputed to be important --they, i say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,
but to the contrary, when they saw that i had been entrusted with the good news for the uncircumcision, even as peter with the good news for the circumcision
;
and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, james and cephas and john, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the gentiles, and they to the circumcision
they only asked us to remember the poor--which very thing i was also zealous to do
but when peter came to antioch, i resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned
for before some people came from james, he ate with the gentiles
but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision
and the rest of the jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy
but when i saw that they didnt walk uprightly according to the truth of the good news, i said to peter before them all, if you, being a jew, live as the gentiles do, and not as the jews do, why do you compel the gentiles to live as the jews do?
we, being jews by nature, and not gentile sinners,
yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ, even we believed in christ jesus, that we might be justified by faith in christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law
but if, while we sought to be justified in christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is christ a servant of sin? certainly not!
for if i build up again those things which i destroyed, i prove myself a law-breaker
for i, through the law, died to the law, that i might live to god
i have been crucified with christ, and it is no longer i that live, but christ living in me
that life which i now live in the flesh, i live by faith in the son of god, who loved me, and gave himself up for me
i dont make void the grace of god
for if righteousness is through the law, then christ died for nothing!
foolish galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes jesus christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?
i just want to learn this from you
did you receive the spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
are you so foolish? having begun in the spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?
did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?
he therefore who supplies the spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
even as abraham believed god, and it was counted to him for righteousness
know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of abraham
the scripture, foreseeing that god would justify the gentiles by faith, preached the good news beforehand to abraham, saying, in you all the nations will be blessed
so then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful abraham
for as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse
for it is written, cursed is everyone who doesnt continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them
now that no man is justified by the law before god is evident, for, the righteous will live by faith
the law is not of faith, but, the man who does them will live by them
christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us
for it is written, cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,
that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through christ jesus; that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a mans covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it
now the promises were spoken to abraham and to his seed
he doesnt say, to seeds, as of many, but as of one, to your seed, which is christ
now i say this
a covenant confirmed beforehand by god in christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect
for if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but god has granted it to abraham by promise
what then is the law? it was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made
it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator
now a mediator is not between one, but god is one
is the law then against the promises of god? certainly not! for if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law
but the scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe
but before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed
so that the law has become our tutor to bring us to christ, that we might be justified by faith
but now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor
for you are all children of god, through faith in christ jesus
for as many of you as were baptized into christ have put on christ
there is neither jew nor greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in christ jesus
if you are christs, then you are abrahams seed and heirs according to promise
but i say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;
but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father
so we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world
but when the fullness of the time came, god sent out his son, born to a woman, born under the law,
that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children
and because you are children, god sent out the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, abba, father!
so you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of god through christ
however at that time, not knowing god, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods
but now that you have come to know god, or rather to be known by god, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?
you observe days, months, seasons, and years
i am afraid for you, that i might have wasted my labor for you
i beg you, brothers, become as i am, for i also have become as you are
you did me no wrong,
but you know that because of weakness of the flesh i preached the good news to you the first time
that which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didnt despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of god, even as christ jesus
what was the blessing you enjoyed? for i testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me
so then, have i become your enemy by telling you the truth?
they zealously seek you in no good way
no, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them
but it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when i am present with you
my little children, of whom i am again in travail until christ is formed in you--
but i could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for i am perplexed about you
tell me, you that desire to be under the law, dont you listen to the law?
for it is written that abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman
however, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise
these things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants
one is from mount sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is hagar
for this hagar is mount sinai in arabia, and answers to the jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children
but the jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all
for it is written, rejoice, you barren who dont bear
break forth and shout, you that dont travail
for more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband
now we, brothers, as isaac was, are children of promise
but as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the spirit, so also it is now
however what does the scripture say? throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman
so then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman
stand firm therefore in the liberty by which christ has made us free, and dont be entangled again with a yoke of bondage
behold, i, paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, christ will profit you nothing
yes, i testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law
you are alienated from christ, you who desire to be justified by the law
you have fallen away from grace
for we, through the spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness
for in christ jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love
you were running well! who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?
this persuasion is not from him who calls you
a little yeast grows through the whole lump
i have confidence toward you in the lord that you will think no other way
but he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is
but i, brothers, if i still preach circumcision, why am i still persecuted? then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed
i wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off
for you, brothers, were called for freedom
only dont use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this
you shall love your neighbor as yourself
but if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you dont consume one another
but i say, walk by the spirit, and you wont fulfill the lust of the flesh
for the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire
but if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law
now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are
adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,
idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which i forewarn you, even as i also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of god
but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,
gentleness, and self-control
against such things there is no law
those who belong to christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts
if we live by the spirit, lets also walk by the spirit
lets not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another
brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also arent tempted
bear one anothers burdens, and so fulfill the law of christ
for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself
but let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor
for each man will bear his own burden
but let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches
dont be deceived
god is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap
for he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption
but he who sows to the spirit will from the spirit reap eternal life
let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we dont give up
so then, as we have opportunity, lets do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith
see with what large letters i write to you with my own hand
as many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of christ
for even they who receive circumcision dont keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh
but far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our lord jesus christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and i to the world
for in christ jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation
as many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on gods israel
from now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for i bear the marks of the lord jesus branded on my body
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit, brothers
amen
paul, an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god, to the saints who are at ephesus, and the faithful in christ jesus
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ;
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;
having predestined us for adoption as children through jesus christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,
to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the beloved,
in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;
to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in christ
in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the good news of your salvation--in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise,
who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of gods own possession, to the praise of his glory
for this cause i also, having heard of the faith in the lord jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,
dont cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
that the god of our lord jesus christ, the father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
which he worked in christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come
he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,
which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all
you were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins,
in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;
among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest
but god, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,
even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with christ,
and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus;
for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of god,
not of works, that no one would boast
for we are his workmanship, created in christ jesus for good works, which god prepared before that we would walk in them
therefore remember that once you, the gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision, ;
that you were at that time separate from christ, alienated from the commonwealth of israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without god in the world
but now in christ jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of christ
for he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,
having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;
and might reconcile them both in one body to god through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby
he came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near
for through him we both have our access in one spirit to the father
so then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of god,
being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, christ jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;
in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the lord;
in whom you also are built together for a habitation of god in the spirit
for this cause i, paul, am the prisoner of christ jesus on behalf of you gentiles,
if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of god which was given me toward you;
how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as i wrote before in few words,
by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of christ;
which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the spirit;
that the gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in christ jesus through the good news,
of which i was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of god which was given me according to the working of his power
to me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ,
and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in god, who created all things through jesus christ;
to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of god might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord;
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him
therefore i ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory
for this cause, i bow my knees to the father of our lord jesus christ,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inward man;
that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know christs love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of god
now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
to him be the glory in the assembly and in christ jesus to all generations forever and ever
amen
i therefore, the prisoner in the lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,
with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;
being eager to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
there is one body, and one spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;
one lord, one faith, one baptism,
one god and father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all
but to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of christ
therefore he says, when he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men
now this, he ascended, what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?
he who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things
he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers;
for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of christ;
until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the son of god, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ;
that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, christ;
from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love
this i say therefore, and testify in the lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of god, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;
who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness
but you did not learn christ that way;
if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in jesus
that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;
and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
and put on the new man, who in the likeness of god has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth
therefore putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor
for we are members of one another
be angry, and dont sin
dont let the sun go down on your wrath,
neither give place to the devil
let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear
dont grieve the holy spirit of god, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption
let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice
and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as god also in christ forgave you
be therefore imitators of god, as beloved children
walk in love, even as christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet-smelling fragrance
but sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;
nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks
know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and god
let no one deceive you with empty words
for because of these things, the wrath of god comes on the children of disobedience
therefore dont be partakers with them
for you were once darkness, but are now light in the lord
walk as children of light,
for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,
proving what is well pleasing to the lord
have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them
for the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of
but all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light
therefore he says, awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and christ will shine on you
therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;
redeeming the time, because the days are evil
therefore dont be foolish, but understand what the will of the lord is
dont be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the spirit,
speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the lord;
giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our lord jesus christ, to god, even the father;
subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of christ
wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the lord
for the husband is the head of the wife, and christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body
but as the assembly is subject to christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything
husbands, love your wives, even as christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;
that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,
that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish
even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies
he who loves his own wife loves himself
for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the lord also does the assembly;
because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones
for this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife
the two will become one flesh
this mystery is great, but i speak concerning christ and of the assembly
nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband
children, obey your parents in the lord, for this is right
honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise
that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth
you fathers, dont provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the lord
servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to christ;
not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of christ, doing the will of god from the heart;
with good will doing service, as to the lord, and not to men;
knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the lord, whether he is bound or free
you masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him
finally, be strong in the lord, and in the strength of his might
put on the whole armor of god, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
for our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the worlds rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places
therefore put on the whole armor of god, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand
stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the good news of peace;
above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one
and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of god;
with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints
on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the good news,
for which i am an ambassador in chains; that in it i may speak boldly, as i ought to speak
but that you also may know my affairs, how i am doing, tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the lord, will make known to you all things;
whom i have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts
peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from god the father and the lord jesus christ
grace be with all those who love our lord jesus christ with incorruptible love
amen
paul, an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god, and timothy our brother,
to the saints and faithful brothers in christ at colossae
grace to you and peace from god our father, and the lord jesus christ
we give thanks to god the father of our lord jesus christ, praying always for you,
having heard of your faith in christ jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,
because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the good news,
which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of god in truth;
even as you learned of epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of christ on our behalf,
who also declared to us your love in the spirit
for this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, dont cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
that you may walk worthily of the lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of god;
strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;
giving thanks to the father, who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love;
in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins;
who is the image of the invisible god, the firstborn of all creation
for by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him
he is before all things, and in him all things are held together
he is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence
for all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;
and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross
you, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,
yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,
if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good news which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which i, paul, was made a servant
now i rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake, which is the assembly;
of which i was made a servant, according to the stewardship of god which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of god,
the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations
but now it has been revealed to his saints,
to whom god was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles, which is christ in you, the hope of glory;
whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus;
for which i also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily
for i desire to have you know how greatly i struggle for you, and for those at laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of god, both of the father and of christ,
in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden
now this i say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech
for though i am absent in the flesh, yet am i with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in christ
as therefore you received christ jesus, the lord, walk in him,
rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving
be careful that you dont let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after christ
for in him all the fullness of the godhead dwells bodily,
and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power;
in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of christ;
having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of god, who raised him from the dead
you were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh
he made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,
wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;
having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it
let no one therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day,
which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is christs
let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
and not holding firmly to the head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with gods growth
if you died with christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,
dont handle, nor taste, nor touch
, according to the precepts and doctrines of men?
which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but arent of any value against the indulgence of the flesh
if then you were raised together with christ, seek the things that are above, where christ is, seated on the right hand of god
set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth
for you died, and your life is hidden with christ in god
when christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory
put to death therefore your members which are on the earth
sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
for which things sake the wrath of god comes on the children of disobedience
you also once walked in those, when you lived in them;
but now you also put them all away
anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth
dont lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,
and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his creator,
where there cant be greek and jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, scythian, bondservant, freeman; but christ is all, and in all
put on therefore, as gods chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;
bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as christ forgave you, so you also do
above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection
and let the peace of god rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful
let the word of christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the lord
whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the lord jesus, giving thanks to god the father, through him
wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the lord
husbands, love your wives, and dont be bitter against them
children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the lord
fathers, dont provoke your children, so that they wont be discouraged
servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing god
and whatever you do, work heartily, as for the lord, and not for men,
knowing that from the lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the lord christ
but he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality
masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a master in heaven
continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
praying together for us also, that god may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of christ, for which i am also in bonds;
that i may reveal it as i ought to speak
walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time
let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one
all my affairs will be made known to you by tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the lord
i am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,
together with onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you
they will make known to you everything that is going on here
aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and mark, the cousin of barnabas,
and jesus who is called justus
these are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of god who are of the circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me
epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god
for i testify about him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in laodicea, and for those in hierapolis
luke, the beloved physician, and demas greet you
greet the brothers who are in laodicea, and nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house
when this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from laodicea
tell archippus, take heed to the ministry which you have received in the lord, that you fulfill it
the salutation of me, paul, with my own hand
remember my bonds
grace be with you
amen
paul, silvanus, and timothy, to the assembly of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
we always give thanks to god for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,
remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ, before our god and father
we know, brothers loved by god, that you are chosen,
and that our good news came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the holy spirit, and with much assurance
you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake
you became imitators of us, and of the lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the holy spirit,
so that you became an example to all who believe in macedonia and in achaia
for from you the word of the lord has been declared, not only in macedonia and achaia, but also in every place your faith toward god has gone out; so that we need not to say anything
for they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to god from idols, to serve a living and true god,
and to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come
for you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you wasnt in vain,
but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at philippi, we grew bold in our god to tell you the good news of god in much conflict
for our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception
but even as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but god, who tests our hearts
for neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness,
nor seeking glory from men, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of christ
but we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children
even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the good news of god only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us
for you remember, brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the good news of god
you are witnesses with god, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe
as you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his own children,
to the end that you should walk worthily of god, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory
for this cause we also thank god without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of god, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of god, which also works in you who believe
for you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of god which are in judea in christ jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the jews;
who killed both the lord jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out, and didnt please god, and are contrary to all men;
forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always
but wrath has come on them to the uttermost
but we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,
because we wanted to come to you--indeed, i, paul, once and again--but satan hindered us
for what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? isnt it even you, before our lord jesus at his coming?
for you are our glory and our joy
therefore when we couldnt stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at athens alone,
and sent timothy, our brother and gods servant in the good news of christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;
that no one be moved by these afflictions
for you know that we are appointed to this task
for most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know
for this cause i also, when i couldnt stand it any longer, sent that i might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain
but when timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;
for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith
for now we live, if you stand fast in the lord
for what thanksgiving can we render again to god for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our god;
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
now may our god and father himself, and our lord jesus christ, direct our way to you;
and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,
to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our god and father, at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints
finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the lord jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please god, that you abound more and more
for you know what instructions we gave you through the lord jesus
for this is the will of god
your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,
that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
not in the passion of lust, even as the gentiles who dont know god;
that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified
for god called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification
therefore he who rejects this doesnt reject man, but god, who has also given his holy spirit to you
but concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you
for you yourselves are taught by god to love one another,
for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all macedonia
but we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we instructed you;
that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing
but we dont want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you dont grieve like the rest, who have no hope
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again, even so god will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in jesus
for this we tell you by the word of the lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep
for the lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with gods trumpet
the dead in christ will rise first,
then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the lord in the air
so we will be with the lord forever
therefore comfort one another with these words
but concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you
for you yourselves know well that the day of the lord comes like a thief in the night
for when they are saying, peace and safety, then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape
but you, brothers, arent in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief
you are all children of light, and children of the day
we dont belong to the night, nor to darkness,
so then lets not sleep, as the rest do, but lets watch and be sober
for those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night
but let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation
for god didnt appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our lord jesus christ,
who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him
therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do
but we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the lord, and admonish you,
and to respect and honor them in love for their works sake
be at peace among yourselves
we exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all
see that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all
rejoice always
pray without ceasing
in everything give thanks, for this is the will of god in christ jesus toward you
dont quench the spirit
dont despise prophesies
test all things, and hold firmly that which is good
abstain from every form of evil
may the god of peace himself sanctify you completely
may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ
he who calls you is faithful, who will also do it
brothers, pray for us
greet all the brothers with a holy kiss
i solemnly command you by the lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
amen
paul, silvanus, and timothy, to the assembly of the thessalonians in god our father, and the lord jesus christ
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
we are bound to always give thanks to god for you, brothers, even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;
so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure
this is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of god, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god, for which you also suffer
since it is a righteous thing with god to repay affliction to those who afflict you,
and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
giving vengeance to those who dont know god, and to those who dont obey the good news of our lord jesus,
who will pay the penalty
eternal destruction from the face of the lord and from the glory of his might,
when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed  in that day
to this end we also pray always for you, that our god may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;
that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
now, brothers, concerning the coming of our lord jesus christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you
not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of christ had come
let no one deceive you in any way
for it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,
he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called god or that is worshiped; so that he sits as god in the temple of god, setting himself up as god
dont you remember that, when i was still with you, i told you these things?
now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season
for the mystery of lawlessness already works
only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way
then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;
even he whose coming is according to the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didnt receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved
because of this, god sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie;
that they all might be judged who didnt believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness
but we are bound to always give thanks to god for you, brothers loved by the lord, because god chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief in the truth;
to which he called you through our good news, for the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ
so then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter
now our lord jesus christ himself, and god our father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word
finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you;
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith
but the lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one
we have confidence in the lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command
may the lord direct your hearts into the love of god, and into the patience of christ
now we command you, brothers, in the name of our lord jesus christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us
for you know how you ought to imitate us
for we didnt behave ourselves rebelliously among you,
neither did we eat bread from anyones hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you;
not because we dont have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us
for even when we were with you, we commanded you this
if anyone will not work, neither let him eat
for we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who dont work at all, but are busybodies
now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread
but you, brothers, dont be weary in doing well
if any man doesnt obey our word in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed
dont count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother
now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways
the lord be with you all
the greeting of me, paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter
this is how i write
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all
amen
paul, an apostle of christ jesus according to the commandment of god our savior, and christ jesus our hope;
to timothy, my true child in faith
grace, mercy, and peace, from god our father and christ jesus our lord
as i urged you when i was going into macedonia, stay at ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than gods stewardship, which is in faith--
but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith;
from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;
desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm
but we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,
as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;
according to the good news of the glory of the blessed god, which was committed to my trust
and i thank him who enabled me, christ jesus our lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;
although i was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent
however, i obtained mercy, because i did it ignorantly in unbelief
the grace of our lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in christ jesus
the saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom i am chief
however, for this cause i obtained mercy, that in me first, jesus christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life
now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, to god who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever
amen
this instruction i commit to you, my child timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;
holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;
of whom is hymenaeus and alexander; whom i delivered to satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme
i exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men
for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence
for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior;
who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth
for there is one god, and one mediator between god and men, the man christ jesus,
who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;
to which i was appointed a preacher and an apostle, a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth
i desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting
in the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;
but  with good works
let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection
but i dont permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness
for adam was first formed, then eve
adam wasnt deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;
but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety
this is a faithful saying
if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a good work
the overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;
not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;
one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;

not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil
moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil
servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience
let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they are blameless
their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things
let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well
for those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus
these things i write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
but if i wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in gods house, which is the assembly of the living god, the pillar and ground of the truth
without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great
god was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory
but the spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,
through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;
forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth
for every creature of god is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving
for it is sanctified through the word of god and prayer
if you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of christ jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed
but refuse profane and old wives fables
exercise yourself toward godliness
for bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come
this saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance
for to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living god, who is the savior of all men, especially of those who believe
command and teach these things
let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity
until i come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching
dont neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders
be diligent in these things
give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all
pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching
continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you
dont rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;
the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity
honor widows who are widows indeed
but if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of god
now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on god, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day
but she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives
also command these things, that they may be without reproach
but if anyone doesnt provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever
let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work
but refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against christ, they desire to marry;
having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge
besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house
not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not
i desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting
for already some have turned aside after satan
if any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and dont let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed
let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching
for the scripture says, you shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain
and, the laborer is worthy of his wages
dont receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses
those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear
i command you in the sight of god, and christ jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality
lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other mens sins
keep yourself pure
be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomachs sake and your frequent infirmities
some mens sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later
in the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise cant be hidden
let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of god and the doctrine not be blasphemed
those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved
teach and exhort these things
if anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesnt consent to sound words, the words of our lord jesus christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions,
constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain
withdraw yourself from such
but godliness with contentment is great gain
for we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly cant carry anything out
but having food and clothing, we will be content with that
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction
for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil
some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows
but you, man of god, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness
fight the good fight of faith
lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses
i command you before god, who gives life to all things, and before christ jesus, who before pontius pilate testified the good confession,
that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our lord jesus christ;
which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only ruler, the king of kings, and lord of lords;
who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see
to whom be honor and eternal power
amen
charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living god, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;
that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life
timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;
which some professing have erred concerning the faith
grace be with you
amen
paul, an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god, according to the promise of the life which is in christ jesus,
to timothy, my beloved child
grace, mercy, and peace, from god the father and christ jesus our lord
i thank god, whom i serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience
how unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day
longing to see you, remembering your tears, that i may be filled with joy;
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother lois, and your mother eunice, and, i am persuaded, in you also
for this cause, i remind you that you should stir up the gift of god which is in you through the laying on of my hands
for god didnt give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control
therefore dont be ashamed of the testimony of our lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the good news according to the power of god,
who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in christ jesus before times eternal,
but has now been revealed by the appearing of our savior, christ jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the good news
for this, i was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles
for this cause i also suffer these things
yet i am not ashamed, for i know him whom i have believed, and i am persuaded that he is able to guard that which i have committed to him against that day
hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in christ jesus
that good thing which was committed to you, guard through the holy spirit who dwells in us
this you know, that all who are in asia turned away from me; of whom are phygelus and hermogenes
may the lord grant mercy to the house of onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
but when he was in rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
; and in how many things he served at ephesus, you know very well
you therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in christ jesus
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also
you therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of christ jesus
no soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier
also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isnt crowned unless he has competed by the rules
the farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops
consider what i say, and may the lord give you understanding in all things
remember jesus christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of david, according to my good news,
in which i suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal
but gods word isnt chained
therefore i endure all things for the chosen ones sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory
this saying is faithful
for if we died with him, we will also live with him
if we endure, we will also reign with him
if we deny him, he also will deny us
if we are faithless, he remains faithful
he cant deny himself
remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the lord, that they dont argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear
give diligence to present yourself approved by god, a workman who doesnt need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth
but shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,
and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is hymenaeus and philetus;
men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some
however gods firm foundation stands, having this seal, the lord knows those who are his, and, let every one who names the name of the lord depart from unrighteousness
now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay
some are for honor, and some for dishonor
if anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the masters use, prepared for every good work
flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the lord out of a pure heart
but refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife
the lords servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,
in gentleness correcting those who oppose him
perhaps god may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,
and they may recover themselves out of the devils snare, having been taken captive by him to his will
but know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come
for men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god;
holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power
turn away from these, also
for some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
even as jannes and jambres opposed moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are rejected
but they will proceed no further
for their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be
but you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,
persecutions, and sufferings
those things that happened to me at antioch, iconium, and lystra
i endured those persecutions
out of them all the lord delivered me
yes, and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution
but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived
but you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them
from infancy, you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in christ jesus
every scripture is god-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,
that the man of god may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work
i command you therefore before god and the lord jesus christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom
preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching
for the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;
and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables
but you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry
for i am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come
i have fought the good fight
i have finished the course
i have kept the faith
from now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing
be diligent to come to me soon,
for demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to thessalonica; crescens to galatia, and titus to dalmatia
only luke is with me
take mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service
but i sent tychicus to ephesus
bring the cloak that i left at troas with carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments
alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me
the lord will repay him according to his works,
of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words
at my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me
may it not be held against them
but the lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the gentiles might hear; and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion
and the lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever
amen
greet prisca and aquila, and the house of onesiphorus
erastus remained at corinth, but i left trophimus at miletus sick
be diligent to come before winter
eubulus salutes you, as do pudens, linus, claudia, and all the brothers
the lord jesus christ be with your spirit
grace be with you
amen
paul, a servant of god, and an apostle of jesus christ, according to the faith of gods chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
in hope of eternal life, which god, who cant lie, promised before time began;
but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which i was entrusted according to the commandment of god our savior;
to titus, my true child according to a common faith
grace, mercy, and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ our savior
i left you in crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as i directed you;
if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior
for the overseer must be blameless, as gods steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;
holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him
for there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gains sake
one of them, a prophet of their own, said, cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons
this testimony is true
for this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
not paying attention to jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth
to the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled
they profess that they know god, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work
but say the things which fit sound doctrine,
that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience
and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that gods word may not be blasphemed
likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;
in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,
and soundness of speech that cant be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us
exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of god, our savior, in all things
for the grace of god has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great god and savior, jesus christ;
who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works
say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority
let no man despise you
remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men
for we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another
but when the kindness of god our savior and his love toward mankind appeared,
not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the holy spirit,
whom he poured out on us richly, through jesus christ our savior;
that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
this saying is faithful, and concerning these things i desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed god may be careful to maintain good works
these things are good and profitable to men;
but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain
avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned
when i send artemas to you, or tychicus, be diligent to come to me to nicopolis, for i have determined to winter there
send zenas, the lawyer, and apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them
let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful
all who are with me greet you
greet those who love us in faith
grace be with you all
amen
paul, a prisoner of christ jesus, and timothy our brother, to philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
to the beloved apphia, to archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
i thank my god always, making mention of you in my prayers,
hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the lord jesus, and toward all the saints;
that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in christ jesus
for we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother
therefore though i have all boldness in christ to command you that which is appropriate,
yet for loves sake i rather beg, being such a one as paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of jesus christ
i beg you for my child, whom i have become the father of in my chains, onesimus,
who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me
i am sending him back
therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
whom i desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the good news
but i was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will
for perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,
no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the lord
if then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me
but if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account
i, paul, write this with my own hand
i will repay it 
yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the lord
refresh my heart in the lord
having confidence in your obedience, i write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what i say
also, prepare a guest room for me, for i hope that through your prayers i will be restored to you
epaphras, my fellow prisoner in christ jesus, greets you,
as do mark, aristarchus, demas, and luke, my fellow workers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit
amen
god, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds
his son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high;
having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have
for to which of the angels did he say at any time, you are my son
today have i become your father? and again, i will be to him a father, and he will be to me a son?
again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, let all the angels of god worship him
of the angels he says, who makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire
but of the son he says, your throne, o god, is forever and ever
the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom
you have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore god, your god, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows
and, you, lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth
the heavens are the works of your hands
they will perish, but you continue
they all will grow old like a garment does
as a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same
your years will not fail
but which of the angels has he told at any time, sit at my right hand, until i make your enemies the footstool of your feet?
arent they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away
for if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;
how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation--which at the first having been spoken through the lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;
god also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the holy spirit, according to his own will?
for he didnt subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels
but one has somewhere testified, saying, what is man, that you think of him? or the son of man, that you care for him?
you made him a little lower than the angels
you crowned him with glory and honor
you have put all things in subjection under his feet
for in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him
but now we dont see all things subjected to him, yet
but we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of god he should taste of death for everyone
for it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings
for both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,
saying, i will declare your name to my brothers
in the midst of the congregation i will sing your praise
again, i will put my trust in him
again, behold, here i am with the children whom god has given me
since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage
for most certainly, he doesnt give help to angels, but he gives help to the seed of abraham
therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god, to make atonement for the sins of the people
for in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted
therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, jesus;
who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was moses in all his house
for he has been counted worthy of more glory than moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house
for every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is god
moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,
but christ is faithful as a son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end
therefore, even as the holy spirit says, today if you will hear his voice,
dont harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
where your fathers tested me by proving me, and saw my works for forty years
therefore i was displeased with that generation, and said, they always err in their heart, but they didnt know my ways;
as i swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest
beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living god;
but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin
for we have become partakers of christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end
while it is said, today if you will hear his voice, dont harden your hearts, as in the rebellion
for who, when they heard, rebelled? no, didnt all those who came out of egypt by moses?
with whom was he displeased forty years? wasnt it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
to whom did he swear that they wouldnt enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief
let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest
for indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didnt profit them, because it wasnt mixed with faith by those who heard
for we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, as i swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world
for he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, god rested on the seventh day from all his works;
and in this place again, they will not enter into my rest
seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,
he again defines a certain day, today, saying through david so long a time afterward, today if you will hear his voice, dont harden your hearts
for if joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day
there remains therefore a sabbath rest for the people of god
for he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as god did from his
let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience
for the word of god is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do
having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, jesus, the son of god, let us hold tightly to our confession
for we dont have a high priest who cant be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin
let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need
for every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to god, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
the high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness
because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself
nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by god, just like aaron was
so also christ didnt glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, you are my son
today i have become your father
as he says also in another place, you are a priest forever, after the order of melchizedek
he, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,
though he was a son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered
having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,
named by god a high priest after the order of melchizedek
about him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing
for although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of god
you have come to need milk, and not solid food
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby
but solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil
therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of christ, let us press on to perfection--not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward god,
of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment
this will we do, if god permits
for concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy spirit,
and tasted the good word of god, and the powers of the age to come,
and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the son of god for themselves again, and put him to open shame
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from god;
but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned
but, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this
for god is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them
we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,
that you wont be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises
for when god made a promise to abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,
saying, surely blessing i will bless you, and multiplying i will multiply you
thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise
for men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation
in this way god, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for god to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us
this hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;
where as a forerunner jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek
for this melchizedek, king of salem, priest of god most high, who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
to whom also abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of salem, which is king of peace;
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the son of god), remains a priest continually
now consider how great this man was, to whom even abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils
they indeed of the sons of levi who receive the priests office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of abraham,
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises
but without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater
here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives
we can say that through abraham even levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,
for he was yet in the body of his father when melchizedek met him
now if there were perfection through the levitical priesthood, what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of melchizedek, and not be called after the order of aaron?
for the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law
for he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar
for it is evident that our lord has sprung out of judah, about which tribe moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood
this is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of melchizedek there arises another priest,
who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life
for it is testified, you are a priest forever, according to the order of melchizedek
for there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
, and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to god
inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath
, but he with an oath by him that says of him, the lord swore and will not change his mind, you are a priest forever, according to the order of melchizedek
by so much, jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant
many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death
but he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable
therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to god through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them
for such a high priest was fitting for us
holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
who doesnt need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people
for he did this once for all, when he offered up himself
for the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a son forever who has been perfected
now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this
we have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens,
a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the lord pitched, not man
for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices
therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer
for if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;
who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as moses was warned by god when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, see, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain
but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law
for if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second
for finding fault with them, he said, behold, the days come, says the lord, that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah;
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers, in the day that i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt; for they didnt continue in my covenant, and i disregarded them, says the lord
for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel
after those days, says the lord; i will put my laws into their mind, i will also write them on their heart
i will be their god, and they will be my people
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen, and every man his brother, saying, know the lord, for all will know me, from their least to their greatest
for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness
i will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more
in that he says, a new covenant, he has made the first old
but that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away
now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary
for a tabernacle was prepared
in the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the holy place
after the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies,
having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, aarons rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;
and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we cant speak now in detail
now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,
but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people
the holy spirit is indicating this, that the way into the holy place wasnt yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;
which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;
being only  fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation
but christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption
for if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh
how much more will the blood of christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to god, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living god?
for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance
for where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it
for a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives
therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood
for when every commandment had been spoken by moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
saying, this is the blood of the covenant which god has commanded you
moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood
according to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission
it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
for christ hasnt entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of god for us;
nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,
or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world
but now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,
so christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation
for the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near
or else wouldnt they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?
but in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins
for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins
therefore when he comes into the world, he says, sacrifice and offering you didnt desire, but you prepared a body for me;
you had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin
then i said, behold, i have come  to do your will, o god
previously saying, sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didnt desire, neither had pleasure in them,
then he has said, behold, i have come to do your will
he takes away the first, that he may establish the second,
by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all
every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,
but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of god;
from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet
for by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified
the holy spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
this is the covenant that i will make with them
after those days, says the lord, i will put my laws on their heart, i will also write them on their mind; then he says,
i will remember their sins and their iniquities no more
now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin
having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of jesus,
by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
and having a great priest over gods house,
lets draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,
let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful
let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,
not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the day approaching
for if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries
a man who disregards moses law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses
how much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the son of god, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the spirit of grace?
for we know him who said, vengeance belongs to me, says the lord, i will repay
again, the lord will judge his people
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
but remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;
partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so
for you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens
therefore dont throw away your boldness, which has a great reward
for you need endurance so that, having done the will of god, you may receive the promise
in a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait
but the righteous will live by faith
if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him
but we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul
now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen
for by this, the elders obtained testimony
by faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of god, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible
by faith, abel offered to god a more excellent sacrifice than cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, god testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks
by faith, enoch was taken away, so that he wouldnt see death, and he was not found, because god translated him
for he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to god
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to god must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him
by faith, noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith
by faith, abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance
he went out, not knowing where he went
by faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with isaac and jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise
for he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is god
by faith, even sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead
these all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
for those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own
if indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return
but now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one
therefore god is not ashamed of them, to be called their god, for he has prepared a city for them
by faith, abraham, being tested, offered up isaac
yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;
even he to whom it was said, in isaac will your seed be called;
concluding that god is able to raise up even from the dead
figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead
by faith, isaac blessed jacob and esau, even concerning things to come
by faith, jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff
by faith, joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones
by faith, moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the kings commandment
by faith, moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter,
choosing rather to share ill treatment with gods people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;
accounting the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt; for he looked to the reward
by faith, he left egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible
by faith, he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them
by faith, they passed through the red sea as on dry land
when the egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up
by faith, the walls of jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days
by faith, rahab the prostitute, didnt perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace
what more shall i say? for the time would fail me if i told of gideon, barak, samson, jephthah, david, samuel, and the prophets;
who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee
women received their dead by resurrection
others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection
others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment
they were stoned
they were sawn apart
they were tempted
they were slain with the sword
they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
, wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth
these all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didnt receive the promise,
god having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect
therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
looking to jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of god
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you dont grow weary, fainting in your souls
you have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;
and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, my son, dont take lightly the chastening of the lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;
for whom the lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives
it is for discipline that you endure
god deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesnt discipline?
but if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children
furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect
shall we not much rather be in subjection to the father of spirits, and live?
for they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness
all chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby
therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,
and make straight paths for your feet, so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed
follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the lord,
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of god; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;
lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like esau, who sold his birthright for one meal
for you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears
for you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,
the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,
for they could not stand that which was commanded, if even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned ;
and so fearful was the appearance, that moses said, i am terrified and trembling
but you have come to mount zion, and to the city of the living god, the heavenly jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,
to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to god the judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,
to jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of abel
see that you dont refuse him who speaks
for if they didnt escape when they refused him who warned on the earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,
whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, yet once more i will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens
this phrase, yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain
therefore, receiving a kingdom that cant be shaken, let us have grace, through which we serve god acceptably, with reverence and awe,
for our god is a consuming fire
let brotherly love continue
dont forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it
remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body
let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled
but god will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers
be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, i will in no way leave you, neither will i in any way forsake you
so that with good courage we say, the lord is my helper
i will not fear
what can man do to me?
remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of god, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith
jesus christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever
dont be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited
we have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat
for the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp
therefore jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate
let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach
for we dont have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come
through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to god continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name
but dont forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices god is well pleased
obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you
pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things
i strongly urge you to do this, that i may be restored to you sooner
now may the god of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our lord jesus,
make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through jesus christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever
amen
but i exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for i have written to you in few words
know that our brother timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, i will see you
greet all of your leaders and all the saints
the italians greet you
grace be with you all
amen
james, a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the dispersion
greetings
count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations,
knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance
let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing
but if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of god, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him
but let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed
for let that man not think that he will receive anything from the lord
he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways
but let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;
and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away
for the sun arises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes
so also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits
blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the lord promised to those who love him
let no man say when he is tempted, i am tempted by god, for god cant be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one
but each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed
then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death
dont be deceived, my beloved brothers
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow
of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures
so, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;
for the anger of man doesnt produce the righteousness of god
therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls 
but be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;
for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was
but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does
if anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesnt bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this mans religion is worthless
pure religion and undefiled before our god and father is this
to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world
my brothers, dont hold the faith of our lord jesus christ of glory with partiality
for if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;
and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, sit here in a good place; and you tell the poor man, stand there, or sit by my footstool;
havent you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
listen, my beloved brothers
didnt god choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love him?
but you have dishonored the poor man
dont the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?
dont they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
however, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, you shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well
but if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors
for whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all
for he who said, do not commit adultery, also said, do not commit murder
now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law
so speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom
for judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy
mercy triumphs over judgment
what good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? can faith save him?
and if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,
and one of you tells them, go in peace, be warmed and filled; and yet you didnt give them the things the body needs, what good is it?
even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself
yes, a man will say, you have faith, and i have works
show me your faith without works, and i by my works will show you my faith
you believe that god is one
you do well
the demons also believe, and shudder
but do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?
wasnt abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up isaac his son on the altar?
you see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;
and the scripture was fulfilled which says, abraham believed god, and it was accounted to him as righteousness; and he was called the friend of god
you see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith
in the same way, wasnt rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead
let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment
for in many things we all stumble
if anyone doesnt stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also
indeed, we put bits into the horses mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body
behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires
so the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things
see how a small fire can spread to a large forest!
and the tongue is a fire
the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by gehenna
for every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind
but nobody can tame the tongue
it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison
with it we bless our god and father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of god
out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing
my brothers, these things ought not to be so
does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water
who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom
but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, dont boast and dont lie against the truth
this wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic
for where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy
now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace
where do wars and fightings among you come from? dont they come from your pleasures that war in your members?
you lust, and dont have
you kill, covet, and cant obtain
you fight and make war
you dont have, because you dont ask
you ask, and dont receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures
you adulterers and adulteresses, dont you know that friendship with the world is enmity with god? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of god
or do you think that the scripture says in vain, the spirit who lives in us yearns jealously?
but he gives more grace
therefore it says, god resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble
be subject therefore to god
but resist the devil, and he will flee from you
draw near to god, and he will draw near to you
cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded
lament, mourn, and weep
let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord, and he will exalt you
dont speak against one another, brothers
he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law
but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge
only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy
but who are you to judge another?
come now, you who say, today or tomorrow lets go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit
whereas you dont know what your life will be like tomorrow
for what is your life? for you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away
for you ought to say, if the lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that
but now you glory in your boasting
all such boasting is evil
to him therefore who knows to do good, and doesnt do it, to him it is sin
come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you
your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten
your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire
you have laid up your treasure in the last days
behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the lord of armies 
you have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure
you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter
you have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one
he doesnt resist you
be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the lord
behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain
you also be patient
establish your hearts, for the coming of the lord is at hand
dont grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you wont be judged
behold, the judge stands at the door
take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord
behold, we call them blessed who endured
you have heard of the patience of job, and have seen the lord in the outcome, and how the lord is full of compassion and mercy
but above all things, my brothers, dont swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no, no; so that you dont fall into hypocrisy
is any among you suffering? let him pray
is any cheerful? let him sing praises
is any among you sick? let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the lord,
and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the lord will raise him up
if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven
confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed
the insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective
elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didnt rain on the earth for three years and six months
he prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit
brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,
let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins
peter, an apostle of jesus christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the dispersion in pontus, galatia, cappadocia, asia, and bithynia,
according to the foreknowledge of god the father, in sanctification of the spirit, that you may obey jesus christ and be sprinkled with his blood
grace to you and peace be multiplied
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead,
to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesnt fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
who by the power of god are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,
that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of jesus christ--
whom not having known you love; in whom, though now you dont see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory--
receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls
concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,
searching for who or what kind of time the spirit of christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of christ, and the glories that would follow them
to them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the holy spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into
therefore prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of jesus christ--
as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,
but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;
because it is written, you shall be holy; for i am holy
if you call on him as father, who without respect of persons judges according to each mans work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear
knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,
but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of christ;
who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,
who through him are believers in god, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in god
seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently
having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of god, which lives and remains forever
for, all flesh is like grass, and all of mans glory like the flower in the grass
the grass withers, and its flower falls;
but the lords word endures forever
this is the word of good news which was preached to you
putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,
as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby,
if indeed you have tasted that the lord is gracious
coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by god, precious
you also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to god through jesus christ
because it is contained in scripture, behold, i lay in zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious
he who believes in him will not be disappointed
for you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected, has become the chief cornerstone,
and, a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense
for they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed
but you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for gods own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
who in time past were no people, but now are gods people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy
beloved, i beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify god in the day of visitation
therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake
whether to the king, as supreme;
or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well
for this is the will of god, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of god
honor all men
love the brotherhood
fear god
honor the king
servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked
for it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward god
for what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? but if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with god
for to this you were called, because christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,
who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth
who, when he was cursed, didnt curse back
when he suffered, didnt threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed
for you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls
in the same way, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any dont obey the word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;
seeing your pure behavior in fear
let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;
but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of god very precious
for this is how the holy women before, who hoped in god also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands
as sarah obeyed abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror
you husbands, in the same way, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered
finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous,
not rendering evil for evil, or insult for insult; but instead blessing; knowing that to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing
for, he who would love life, and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit
let him turn away from evil, and do good
let him seek peace, and pursue it
for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the lord is against those who do evil
now who is he who will harm you, if you become imitators of that which is good?
but even if you should suffer for righteousness sake, you are blessed
dont fear what they fear, neither be troubled
but sanctify the lord god in your hearts; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear
having a good conscience; that, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in christ
for it is better, if it is gods will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil
because christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to god; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,
who before were disobedient, when god waited patiently in the days of noah, while the ship was being built
in it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water
this is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you--not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward god, through the resurrection of jesus christ,
who is at the right hand of god, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him
forasmuch then as christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;
that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of god
for we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries
they think it is strange that you dont run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming
who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead
for to this end the good news was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to god in the spirit
but the end of all things is near
therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer
and above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins
be hospitable to one another without grumbling
as each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of god in its various forms
if anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of god
if anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which god supplies, that in all things god may be glorified through jesus christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever
amen
beloved, dont be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you
but because you are partakers of christs sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy
if you are insulted for the name of christ, you are blessed; because the spirit of glory and of god rests on you
on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified
for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other mens matters
but if one of you suffers for being a christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify god in this matter
for the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of god
if it begins first with us, what will happen to those who dont obey the good news of god?
if it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?
therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of god in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful creator
i exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed
shepherd the flock of god which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;
neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock
when the chief shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesnt fade away
likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder
yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for god resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god, that he may exalt you in due time;
casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you
be sober and self-controlled
be watchful
your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour
withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings
but may the god of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by christ jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you
to him be the glory and the power forever and ever
amen
through silvanus, our faithful brother, as i consider him, i have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of god in which you stand
she who is in babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does mark, my son
greet one another with a kiss of love
peace be to you all who are in christ jesus
amen
simon peter, a servant and apostle of jesus christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our god and savior, jesus christ
grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord,
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;
by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust
yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;
and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness;
and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love
for if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
for he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins
therefore, brothers, be more diligent to make your calling and election sure
for if you do these things, you will never stumble
for thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior, jesus christ
therefore i will not be negligent to remind you of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth
i think it right, as long as i am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;
knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly, even as our lord jesus christ made clear to me
yes, i will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure
for we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty
for he received from god the father honor and glory, when the voice came to him from the majestic glory, this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased
we heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain
we have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts
knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation
for no prophecy ever came by the will of man
but holy men of god spoke, being moved by the holy spirit
but false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction
many will follow their immoral ways, and as a result, the way of the truth will be maligned
in covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words
whose sentence now from of old doesnt linger, and their destruction will not slumber
for if god didnt spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to tartarus, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;
and didnt spare the ancient world, but preserved noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;
and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly;
and delivered righteous lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked

the lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;
but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority
daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;
whereas angels, though greater in might and power, dont bring a railing judgment against them before the lord
but these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,
receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;
having eyes full of adultery, and who cant cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;
forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of balaam the son of beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing;
but he was rebuked for his own disobedience
a mute donkey spoke with a mans voice and stopped the madness of the prophet
these are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever
for, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error;
promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him
for if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first
for it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them
but it has happened to them according to the true proverb, the dog turns to his own vomit again, and the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire
this is now, beloved, the second letter that i have written to you; and in both of them i stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles of the lord and savior
knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come, walking after their own lusts,
and saying, where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation
for this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of god;
by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished
but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men
but dont forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day
the lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance
but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up
therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,
looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of god, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
but, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells
therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in his sight
regard the patience of our lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you;
as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things
in those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other scriptures, to their own destruction
you therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ
to him be the glory both now and forever
amen
that which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the word of life
;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us
yes, and our fellowship is with the father, and with his son, jesus christ
and we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled
this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that god is light, and in him is no darkness at all
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and dont tell the truth
but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of jesus christ, his son, cleanses us from all sin
if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us
if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
if we say that we havent sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us
my little children, i write these things to you so that you may not sin
if anyone sins, we have a counselor with the father, jesus christ, the righteous
and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world
this is how we know that we know him
if we keep his commandments
one who says, i know him, and doesnt keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isnt in him
but whoever keeps his word, gods love has most certainly been perfected in him
this is how we know that we are in him
he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked
brothers, i write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning
the old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning
again, i write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines
he who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now
he who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him
but he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesnt know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes
i write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake
i write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning
i write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one
i write to you, little children, because you know the father
i have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning
i have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of god remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one
dont love the world, neither the things that are in the world
if anyone loves the world, the fathers love isnt in him
for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isnt the fathers, but is the worlds
the world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does gods will remains forever
little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen
by this we know that it is the final hour
they went out from us, but they didnt belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us
but they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us
you have an anointing from the holy one, and you all have knowledge
i have not written to you because you dont know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth
who is the liar but he who denies that jesus is the christ? this is the antichrist, he who denies the father and the son
whoever denies the son, the same doesnt have the father
he who confesses the son has the father also
therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning
if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the son, and in the father
this is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life
these things i have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray
as for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you dont need for anyone to teach you
but as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him
now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming
if you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him
behold, how great a love the father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of god! for this cause the world doesnt know us, because it didnt know him
beloved, now we are children of god, and it is not yet revealed what we will be
but we know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is
everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure
everyone who sins also commits lawlessness
sin is lawlessness
you know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and in him is no sin
whoever remains in him doesnt sin
whoever sins hasnt seen him, neither knows him
little children, let no one lead you astray
he who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous
he who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning
to this end the son of god was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil
whoever is born of god doesnt commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he cant sin, because he is born of god
in this the children of god are revealed, and the children of the devil
whoever doesnt do righteousness is not of god, neither is he who doesnt love his brother
for this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;
unlike cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother
why did he kill him? because his works were evil, and his brothers righteous
dont be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you
we know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers
he who doesnt love his brother remains in death
whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him
by this we know love, because he laid down his life for us
and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers
but whoever has the worlds goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of god remain in him?
my little children, lets not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth
and by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him,
because if our heart condemns us, god is greater than our heart, and knows all things
beloved, if our hearts dont condemn us, we have boldness toward god;
and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight
this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his son, jesus christ, and love one another, even as he commanded
he who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him
by this we know that he remains in us, by the spirit which he gave us
beloved, dont believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of god, because many false prophets have gone out into the world
by this you know the spirit of god
every spirit who confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god,
and every spirit who doesnt confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes
now it is in the world already
you are of god, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world
they are of the world
therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them
we are of god
he who knows god listens to us
he who is not of god doesnt listen to us
by this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error
beloved, let us love one another, for love is of god; and everyone who loves is born of god, and knows god
he who doesnt love doesnt know god, for god is love
by this gods love was revealed in us, that god has sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him
in this is love, not that we loved god, but that he loved us, and sent his son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins
beloved, if god loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another
no one has seen god at any time
if we love one another, god remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us
by this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his spirit
we have seen and testify that the father has sent the son as the savior of the world
whoever confesses that jesus is the son of god, god remains in him, and he in god
we know and have believed the love which god has for us
god is love, and he who remains in love remains in god, and god remains in him
in this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world
there is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment
he who fears is not made perfect in love
we love him, because he first loved us
if a man says, i love god, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesnt love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love god whom he has not seen?
this commandment we have from him, that he who loves god should also love his brother
whoever believes that jesus is the christ is born of god
whoever loves the father also loves the child who is born of him
by this we know that we love the children of god, when we love god and keep his commandments
for this is the love of god, that we keep his commandments
his commandments are not grievous
for whatever is born of god overcomes the world
this is the victory that has overcome the world
your faith
who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that jesus is the son of god?
this is he who came by water and blood, jesus christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood
it is the spirit who testifies, because the spirit is the truth
for there are three who testify 
the spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one
if we receive the witness of men, the witness of god is greater; for this is gods testimony which he has testified concerning his son
he who believes in the son of god has the testimony in himself
he who doesnt believe god has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that god has given concerning his son
the testimony is this, that god gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his son
he who has the son has the life
he who doesnt have gods son doesnt have the life
these things i have written to you who believe in the name of the son of god, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the son of god
this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us
and if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him
if anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and god will give him life for those who sin not leading to death
there is a sin leading to death
i dont say that he should make a request concerning this
all unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death
we know that whoever is born of god doesnt sin, but he who was born of god keeps himself, and the evil one doesnt touch him
we know that we are of god, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one
we know that the son of god has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his son jesus christ
this is the true god, and eternal life
little children, keep yourselves from idols
the elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom i love in truth; and not i only, but also all those who know the truth;
for the truths sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever
grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from god the father, and from the lord jesus christ, the son of the father, in truth and love
i rejoice greatly that i have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the father
now i beg you, dear lady, not as though i wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another
this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments
this is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it
for many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who dont confess that jesus christ came in the flesh
this is the deceiver and the antichrist
watch yourselves, that we dont lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward
whoever transgresses and doesnt remain in the teaching of christ, doesnt have god
he who remains in the teaching, the same has both the father and the son
if anyone comes to you, and doesnt bring this teaching, dont receive him into your house, and dont welcome him,
for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works
having many things to write to you, i dont want to do so with paper and ink, but i hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full
the children of your chosen sister greet you
amen
the elder to gaius the beloved, whom i love in truth
beloved, i pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers
for i rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in truth
i have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children walking in truth
beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers
they have testified about your love before the assembly
you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of god,
because for the sake of the name they went out, taking nothing from the gentiles
we therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth
i wrote to the assembly, but diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesnt accept what we say
therefore if i come, i will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words
not content with this, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the assembly
beloved, dont imitate that which is evil, but that which is good
he who does good is of god
he who does evil hasnt seen god
demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true
i had many things to write to you, but i am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;
but i hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face
peace be to you
the friends greet you
greet the friends by name
jude, a servant of jesus christ, and brother of james, to those who are called, sanctified by god the father, and kept for jesus christ
mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied
beloved, while i was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, i was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints
for there are certain men who crept in secretly, even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation
ungodly men, turning the grace of our god into indecency, and denying our only master, god, and lord, jesus christ
now i desire to remind you, though you already know this, that the lord, having saved a people out of the land of egypt, afterward destroyed those who didnt believe
angels who didnt keep their first domain, but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day
even as sodom and gomorrah, and the cities around them, having, in the same way as these, given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire
yet in the same way, these also in their dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander celestial beings
but michael, the archangel, when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of moses, dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation, but said, may the lord rebuke you!
but these speak evil of whatever things they dont know
what they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, they are destroyed in these things
woe to them! for they went in the way of cain, and ran riotously in the error of balaam for hire, and perished in korahs rebellion
these are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever
about these also enoch, the seventh from adam, prophesied, saying, behold, the lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
these are murmurers and complainers, walking after their lusts, showing respect of persons to gain advantage
but you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ
they said to you that in the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts
these are they who cause divisions, and are sensual, not having the spirit
but you, beloved, keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the holy spirit
keep yourselves in the love of god, looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ to eternal life
on some have compassion, making a distinction,
and some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh
now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy,
to god our savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever
amen
this is the revelation of jesus christ, which god gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, john,
who testified to gods word, and of the testimony of jesus christ, about everything that he saw
blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is at hand
john, to the seven assemblies that are in asia
grace to you and peace, from god, who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven spirits who are before his throne;
and from jesus christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth
to him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood;
and he made us to be a kingdom, priests to his god and father; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever
amen
behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, including those who pierced him
all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him
even so, amen
i am the alpha and the omega,  says the lord god, who is and who was and who is to come, the almighty
i john, your brother and partner with you in oppression, kingdom, and perseverance in christ jesus, was on the isle that is called patmos because of gods word and the testimony of jesus christ
i was in the spirit on the lords day, and i heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet
saying,  what you see, write in a book and send to the seven assemblies 
to ephesus, smyrna, pergamum, thyatira, sardis, philadelphia, and to laodicea
i turned to see the voice that spoke with me
having turned, i saw seven golden lampstands
and among the lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest
his head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow
his eyes were like a flame of fire
his feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace
his voice was like the voice of many waters
he had seven stars in his right hand
out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword
his face was like the sun shining at its brightest
when i saw him, i fell at his feet like a dead man
he laid his right hand on me, saying, dont be afraid
i am the first and the last,
and the living one
i was dead, and behold, i am alive forevermore
amen
i have the keys of death and of hades 
write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;
the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands
the seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies
the seven lampstands are seven assemblies
to the angel of the assembly in ephesus write
he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things
i know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that you cant tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false
you have perseverance and have endured for my names sake, and have not grown weary
but i have this against you, that you left your first love
remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else i am coming to you swiftly, and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent
but this you have, that you hate the works of the nicolaitans, which i also hate
he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies
to him who overcomes i will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my god
to the angel of the assembly in smyrna write
the first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things
i know your works, oppression, and your poverty, and the blasphemy of those who say they are jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of satan
dont be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer
behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days
be faithful to death, and i will give you the crown of life
he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies
he who overcomes wont be harmed by the second death
to the angel of the assembly in pergamum write
he who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things
i know your works and where you dwell, where satans throne is
you hold firmly to my name, and didnt deny my faith in the days of antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where satan dwells
but i have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of balaam, who taught balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality
so you also have some who hold to the teaching of the nicolaitans likewise 
repent therefore, or else i am coming to you quickly, and i will make war against them with the sword of my mouth
he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies
to him who overcomes, to him i will give of the hidden manna, and i will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it
to the angel of the assembly in thyatira write
the son of god, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things
i know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first
but i have this against you, that you tolerate your woman, jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess
she teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols
i gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality
behold, i will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of her works
i will kill her children with death, and all the assemblies will know that i am he who searches the minds and hearts
i will give to each one of you according to your deeds
but to you i say, to the rest who are in thyatira, as many as dont have this teaching, who dont know what some call the deep things of satan, to you i say, i am not putting any other burden on you
nevertheless, hold that which you have firmly until i come
he who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him i will give authority over the nations
he will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay pots; as i also have received of my father
and i will give him the morning star
he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies
and to the angel of the assembly in sardis write
he who has the seven spirits of god, and the seven stars says these things
i know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead
wake up, and keep the things that remain, which you were about to throw away, for i have found no works of yours perfected before my god
remember therefore how you have received and heard
keep it, and repent
if therefore you wont watch, i will come as a thief, and you wont know what hour i will come upon you
nevertheless you have a few names in sardis that did not defile their garments
they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy
he who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and i will in no way blot his name out of the book of life, and i will confess his name before my father, and before his angels
he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies
to the angel of the assembly in philadelphia write
he who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of david, he who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says these things
i know your works, that you have a little power, and kept my word, and didnt deny my name
behold, i give of the synagogue of satan, of those who say they are jews, and they are not, but lie
behold, i will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that i have loved you
because you kept my command to endure, i also will keep you from the hour of testing, which is to come on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth
i am coming quickly! hold firmly that which you have, so that no one takes your crown
he who overcomes, i will make him a pillar in the temple of my god, and he will go out from there no more
i will write on him the name of my god, and the name of the city of my god, the new jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my god, and my own new name
he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies
to the angel of the assembly in laodicea write
the amen, the faithful and true witness, the head of gods creation, says these things
i know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot
i wish you were cold or hot
so, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, i will vomit you out of my mouth
because you say, i am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and dont know that you are the wretched one, miserable, poor, blind, and naked;
i counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see
as many as i love, i reprove and chasten
be zealous therefore, and repent
behold, i stand at the door and knock
if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, then i will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me
he who overcomes, i will give to him to sit down with me on my throne, as i also overcame, and sat down with my father on his throne
he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the assemblies
after these things i looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that i heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, come up here, and i will show you the things which must happen after this
immediately i was in the spirit
behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne
that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius
there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at
around the throne were twenty-four thrones
on the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads
out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders
there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven spirits of god
before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal
in the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind
the first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle
the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within
they have no rest day and night, saying, holy, holy, holy is the lord god, the almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!
when the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,
the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,
worthy are you, our lord and god, the holy one, to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!
i saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals
i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?
no one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it
and i wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it
one of the elders said to me, dont weep
behold, the lion who is of the tribe of judah, the root of david, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals
i saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of god, sent out into all the earth
then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne
now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints
they sang a new song, saying, you are worthy to take the book, and to open its seals
for you were killed, and bought us for god with your blood, out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,
and made us kings and priests to our god, and we will reign on earth
i saw, and i heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;
saying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!
i heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, to him who sits on the throne, and to the lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! amen! 
the four living creatures said, amen! the elders fell down and worshiped
i saw that the lamb opened one of the seven seals, and i heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, come and see!
and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow
a crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering, and to conquer
when he opened the second seal, i heard the second living creature saying, come!
another came forth, a red horse
to him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another
there was given to him a great sword
when he opened the third seal, i heard the third living creature saying, come and see! and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand
i heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, a choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! dont damage the oil and the wine!
when he opened the fourth seal, i heard the fourth living creature saying, come and see!
and behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it, his name was death
hades followed with him
authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him
when he opened the fifth seal, i saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the word of god, and for the testimony of the lamb which they had
they cried with a loud voice, saying, how long, master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
a long white robe was given to each of them
they were told that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers, who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their course
i saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake
the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood
the stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind
the sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up
every mountain and island were moved out of their places
the kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains
they told the mountains and the rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb,
for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?
after this, i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree
i saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living god
he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,
saying, dont harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our god on their foreheads!
i heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of israel
of the tribe of judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of reuben twelve thousand, of the tribe of gad twelve thousand,
of the tribe of asher twelve thousand, of the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand, of the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand,
of the tribe of simeon twelve thousand, of the tribe of levi twelve thousand, of the tribe of issachar twelve thousand,
of the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand, of the tribe of joseph twelve thousand, of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand
after these things i looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands
they cried with a loud voice, saying, salvation be to our god, who sits on the throne, and to the lamb!
all the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped god,
saying, amen! blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our god forever and ever! amen
one of the elders answered, saying to me, these who are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?
i told him, my lord, you know
he said to me, these are those who came out of the great tribulation
they washed their robes, and made them white in the lambs blood
therefore they are before the throne of god, they serve him day and night in his temple
he who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them
they will never be hungry, neither thirsty any more; neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;
for the lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and leads them to springs of waters of life
and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes
when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour
i saw the seven angels who stand before god, and seven trumpets were given to them
another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer
much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne
the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before god out of the angels hand
the angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth
there followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake
the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound
the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth
one third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up
the second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea
one third of the sea became blood,
and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died
one third of the ships were destroyed
the third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters
the name of the star is called wormwood
one third of the waters became wormwood
many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter
the fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldnt shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way
i saw, and i heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, woe! woe! woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!
the fifth angel sounded, and i saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth
the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him
he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a burning furnace
the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit
then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power
they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who dont have gods seal on their foreheads
they were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months
their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person
in those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it
they will desire to die, and death will flee from them
the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war
on their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like peoples faces
they had hair like womens hair, and their teeth were like those of lions
they had breastplates, like breastplates of iron
the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war
they have tails like those of scorpions, and stings
in their tails they have power to harm men for five months
they have over them as king the angel of the abyss
his name in hebrew is abaddon, but in greek, he has the name apollyon
the first woe is past
behold, there are still two woes coming after this
the sixth angel sounded
i heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before god,
saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, free the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates!
the four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind
the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million 
i heard the number of them
thus i saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions
out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur
by these three plagues were one third of mankind killed
by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths
for the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails
for their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm
the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didnt repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldnt worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk
they didnt repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts
i saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a cloud
a rainbow was on his head
his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire
he had in his hand a little open book
he set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land
he cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars
when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices
when the seven thunders sounded, i was about to write; but i heard a voice from the sky saying, seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and dont write them
the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky,
and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of god is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets
the voice which i heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land
i went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book
he said to me, take it, and eat it up
it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey
i took the little book out of the angels hand, and ate it up
it was as sweet as honey in my mouth
when i had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter
they told me, you must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings
a reed like a rod was given to me
someone said, rise, and measure gods temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it
leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and dont measure it, for it has been given to the nations
they will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months
i will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth
these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing before the lord of the earth
if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies
if anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way
these have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy
they have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire
when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them
their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called sodom and egypt, where also their lord was crucified
from among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will be glad
they will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth
after the three and a half days, the breath of life from god entered into them, and they stood on their feet
great fear fell on those who saw them
i heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, come up here! they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them
in that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell
seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the god of heaven
the second woe is past
behold, the third woe comes quickly
the seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed, saying, the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord, and of his christ
he will reign forever and ever!
the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before gods throne, fell on their faces and worshiped god,
saying
we give you thanks, lord god, the almighty, the one who is and who was ; because you have taken your great power, and reigned
the nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the small and the great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth
gods temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the lords covenant was seen in his temple
lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed
a great sign was seen in heaven
a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars
she was with child
she cried out in pain, laboring to give birth
another sign was seen in heaven
behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth
the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child
she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron
her child was caught up to god, and to his throne
the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by god, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days
there was war in the sky
michael and his angels made war on the dragon
the dragon and his angels made war
they didnt prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven
the great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and satan, the deceiver of the whole world
he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him
i heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, now the salvation, the power, and the kingdom of our god, and the authority of his christ has come; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our god day and night
they overcame him because of the lambs blood, and because of the word of their testimony
they didnt love their life, even to death
therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them
woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child
two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent
the serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream
the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth
the dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep gods commandments and hold jesus testimony
then i stood on the sand of the sea
i saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads
on his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names
the beast which i saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion
the dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority
one of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally
his fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast
they worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, who is like the beast? who is able to make war with him?
a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him
authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him
he opened his mouth for blasphemy against god, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven
it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them
authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him
all who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been killed
if anyone has an ear, let him hear
if anyone is to go into captivity, he will go into captivity
if anyone is to be killed with the sword, he must be killed
here is the endurance and the faith of the saints
i saw another beast coming up out of the earth
he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon
he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence
he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed
he performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people
he deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived
it was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldnt worship the image of the beast to be killed
he causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on their foreheads;
and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name
here is wisdom
he who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man
his number is six hundred sixty-six
i saw, and behold, the lamb standing on mount zion, and with him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his father, written on their foreheads
i heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder
the sound which i heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps
they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders
no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth
these are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins
these are those who follow the lamb wherever he goes
these were redeemed by jesus from among men, the first fruits to god and to the lamb
in their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless
i saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people
he said with a loud voice, fear the lord, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come
worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!
another, a second angel, followed, saying, babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality
another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, if anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,
he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of god, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger
he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the lamb
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever
they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name
here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of god, and the faith of jesus
i heard the voice from heaven saying, write, blessed are the dead who die in the lord from now on
yes, says the spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them
i looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle
another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, send forth your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!
he who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped
another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven
he also had a sharp sickle
another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earths grapes are fully ripe!
the angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of god
the winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia
i saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky
seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them gods wrath is finished
i saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who overcame the beast, his image, and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of god
they sang the song of moses, the servant of god, and the song of the lamb, saying, great and marvelous are your works, lord god, the almighty! righteous and true are your ways, you king of the nations
who wouldnt fear you, lord, and glorify your name? for you only are holy
for all the nations will come and worship before you
for your righteous acts have been revealed
after these things i looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their breasts
one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of god, who lives forever and ever
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god, and from his power
no one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished
i heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of god on the earth!
the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man
every living thing in the sea died
the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood
i heard the angel of the waters saying, you are righteous, who are and who were, you holy one, because you have judged these things
for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink
they deserve this
i heard the altar saying, yes, lord god, the almighty, true and righteous are your judgments
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire
people were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the name of god who has the power over these plagues
they didnt repent and give him glory
the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened
they gnawed their tongues because of the pain,
and they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores
they didnt repent of their works
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the euphrates
its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise
i saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;
for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of that great day of god, the almighty
behold, i come like a thief
blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he doesnt walk naked, and they see his shame
he gathered them together into the place which is called in hebrew, megiddo
the seventh poured out his bowl into the air
a loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, it is done!
there were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty
the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell
babylon the great was remembered in the sight of god, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath
every island fled away, and the mountains were not found
great hailstones, about the weight of a talent, came down out of the sky on people
people blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, come here
i will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,
with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality
he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness
i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns
the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth
and on her forehead a name was written, mystery, babylon the great, the mother of the prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth
i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus
when i saw her, i wondered with great amazement
the angel said to me, why do you wonder? i will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns
the beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction
those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present
here is the mind that has wisdom
the seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits
they are seven kings
five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come
when he comes, he must continue a little while
the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction
the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour
these have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast
these will war against the lamb, and the lamb will overcome them, for he is lord of lords, and king of kings
they also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful
he said to me, the waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages
the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire
for god has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of god should be accomplished
the woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth
after these things, i saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority
the earth was illuminated with his glory
he cried with a mighty voice, saying, fallen, fallen is babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird!
for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury
i heard another voice from heaven, saying, come out of her, my people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you dont receive of her plagues,
for her sins have reached to the sky, and god has remembered her iniquities
return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did, and according to her works
in the cup which she mixed, mix to her double
however much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning
for she says in her heart, i sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning
therefore in one day her plagues will come
death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the lord god who has judged her is strong
the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning,
standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, woe, woe, the great city, babylon, the strong city! for your judgment has come in one hour
the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise any more;
merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and peoples bodies and souls
the fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no more at all
the merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;
saying, woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!
for in an hour such great riches are made desolate
every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,
and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, what is like the great city?
they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth! for in one hour is she made desolate
rejoice over her, o heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets; for god has judged your judgment on her
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, thus with violence will babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all
the voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you
no craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you
the sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you
the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived
in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth
after these things i heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, hallelujah! salvation, power, and glory belong to our god
for true and righteous are his judgments
for he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand
a second said, hallelujah! her smoke goes up forever and ever
the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped god who sits on the throne, saying, amen! hallelujah!
a voice came forth from the throne, saying, give praise to our god, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!
i heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, hallelujah! for the lord our god, the almighty, reigns!
let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to him
for the marriage of the lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready
it was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen
for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints
he said to me, write, blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb
he said to me, these are true words of god
i fell down before his feet to worship him
he said to me, look! dont do it! i am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of jesus
worship god, for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
i saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called faithful and true
in righteousness he judges and makes war
his eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns
he has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself
he is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood
his name is called the word of god
the armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in white, pure, fine linen
out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, that with it he should strike the nations
he will rule them with an iron rod
he treads the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of god, the almighty
he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, king of kings, and lord of lords
i saw an angel standing in the sun
he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, come! be gathered together to the great supper of god,
that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, and small and great
i saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army
the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image
these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur
the rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came forth out of his mouth
all the birds were filled with their flesh
i saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand
he seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand years,
and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished
after this, he must be freed for a short time
i saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them
i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of jesus, and for the word of god, and such as didnt worship the beast nor his image, and didnt receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand
they lived, and reigned with christ for a thousand years
the rest of the dead didnt live until the thousand years were finished
this is the first resurrection
blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection
over these, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of god and of christ, and will reign with him one thousand years
and after the thousand years, satan will be released from his prison,
and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, gog and magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea
they went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city
fire came down out of heaven from god, and devoured them
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also
they will be tormented day and night forever and ever
i saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away
there was found no place for them
i saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books
another book was opened, which is the book of life
the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works
the sea gave up the dead who were in it
death and hades gave up the dead who were in them
they were judged, each one according to his works
death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire
this is the second death, the lake of fire
if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire
i saw a new heaven and a new earth
for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more
i saw the holy city, new jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from god, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband
i heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, behold, gods dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and god himself will be with them as their god
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes
death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more
the first things have passed away
he who sits on the throne said, behold, i am making all things new
he said, write, for these words of god are faithful and true
he said to me, it is done! i am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end
i will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life
he who overcomes, i will give him these things
i will be his god, and he will be my son
but for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death
one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, come here
i will show you the wife, the lambs bride
he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from god,
having the glory of god
her light was like a most precious stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel
on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates
the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
he who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, its gates, and its walls
the city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth
he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand twelve stadia 
its length, breadth, and height are equal
its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel
the construction of its wall was jasper
the city was pure gold, like pure glass
the foundations of the citys wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones
the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire ; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst
the twelve gates were twelve pearls
each one of the gates was made of one pearl
the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass
i saw no temple in it, for the lord god, the almighty, and the lamb, are its temple
the city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of god illuminated it, and its lamp is the lamb
the nations will walk in its light
the kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it
its gates will in no way be shut by day,
and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter
there will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the lambs book of life
he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb,
in the middle of its street
on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every month
the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations
there will be no curse any more
the throne of god and of the lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him
they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads
there will be no night, and they need no lamp light; for the lord god will illuminate them
they will reign forever and ever
he said to me, these words are faithful and true
the lord god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon
behold, i come quickly
blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book
now i, john, am the one who heard and saw these things
when i heard and saw, i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things
he said to me, see you dont do it! i am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book
worship god
he said to me, dont seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand
he who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still
he who is filthy, let him be filthy still
he who is righteous, let him do righteousness still
he who is holy, let him be holy still
behold, i come quickly
my reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work
i am the alpha and the omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end
blessed are those who do his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city
outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood
i, jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies
i am the root and the offspring of david; the bright and morning star
the spirit and the bride say, come! he who hears, let him say, come! he who is thirsty, let him come
he who desires, let him take the water of life freely
i testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to them, may god add to him the plagues which are written in this book
if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, may god take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book
he who testifies these things says, yes, i come quickly
amen! yes, come, lord jesus
the grace of the lord jesus christ be with all the saints
amen
the book of the generation of jesus christ, the son of david, the son of abraham
abraham begat isaac; and isaac begat jacob; and jacob begat judas and his brethren;
and judas begat phares and zara of thamar; and phares begat esrom; and esrom begat aram;
and aram begat aminadab; and aminadab begat naasson; and naasson begat salmon;
and salmon begat booz of rachab; and booz begat obed of ruth; and obed begat jesse;
and jesse begat david the king; and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of urias;
and solomon begat roboam; and roboam begat abia; and abia begat asa;
and asa begat josaphat; and josaphat begat joram; and joram begat ozias;
and ozias begat joatham; and joatham begat achaz; and achaz begat ezekias;
and ezekias begat manasses; and manasses begat amon; and amon begat josias;
and josias begat jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to babylon
and after they were brought to babylon, jechonias begat salathiel; and salathiel begat zorobabel;
and zorobabel begat abiud; and abiud begat eliakim; and eliakim begat azor;
and azor begat sadoc; and sadoc begat achim; and achim begat eliud;
and eliud begat eleazar; and eleazar begat matthan; and matthan begat jacob;
and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary, of whom was born jesus, who is called christ
so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations; and from david until the carrying away into babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are fourteen generations
now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise
when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the holy ghost
then joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily
but while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, joseph, thou son of david, fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife
for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost
and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name jesus
for he shall save his people from their sins
now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet, saying,
behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name emmanuel, which being interpreted is, god with us
then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife
and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son
and he called his name jesus
now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to jerusalem,
saying, where is he that is born king of the jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him
when herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all jerusalem with him
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where christ should be born
and they said unto him, in bethlehem of judaea
for thus it is written by the prophet,
and thou bethlehem, in the land of juda, art not the least among the princes of juda
for out of thee shall come a governor, that shall rule my people israel
then herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared
and he sent them to bethlehem, and said, go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that i may come and worship him also
when they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was
when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
and when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him
and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh
and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod, they departed into their own country another way
and when they were departed, behold, the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream, saying, arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into egypt, and be thou there until i bring thee word
for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
when he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into egypt
and was there until the death of herod
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet, saying, out of egypt have i called my son
then herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet, saying,
in rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not
but when herod was dead, behold, an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt,
saying, arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of israel
for they are dead which sought the young childs life
and he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of israel
but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod, he was afraid to go thither
notwithstanding, being warned of god in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of galilee
and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, he shall be called a nazarene
in those days came john the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of judaea,
and saying, repent ye
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the lord, make his paths straight
and the same john had his raiment of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey
then went out to him jerusalem, and all judaea, and all the region round about jordan,
and were baptized of him in jordan, confessing their sins
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, o generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance
and think not to say within yourselves, we have abraham to our father
for i say unto you, that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees
therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire
i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance
but he that cometh after me is mightier than i, whose shoes i am not worthy to bear
he shall baptize you with the holy ghost, and with fire
whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john, to be baptized of him
but john forbad him, saying, i have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
and jesus answering said unto him, suffer it to be so now
for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness
then he suffered him
and jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water
and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove, and lighting upon him
and lo a voice from heaven, saying, this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased
then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred
and when the tempter came to him, he said, if thou be the son of god, command that these stones be made bread
but he answered and said, it is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
and saith unto him, if thou be the son of god, cast thyself down
for it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee
and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
jesus said unto him, it is written again, thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
and saith unto him, all these things will i give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me
then saith jesus unto him, get thee hence, satan
for it is written, thou shalt worship the lord thy god, and him only shalt thou serve
then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him
now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison, he departed into galilee;
and leaving nazareth, he came and dwelt in capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet, saying,
the land of zabulon, and the land of nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond jordan, galilee of the gentiles;
the people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up
from that time jesus began to preach, and to say, repent
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
and jesus, walking by the sea of galilee, saw two brethren, simon called peter, and andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea
for they were fishers
and he saith unto them, follow me, and i will make you fishers of men
and they straightway left their nets, and followed him
and going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, james the son of zebedee, and john his brother, in a ship with zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them
and they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him
and jesus went about all galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people
and his fame went throughout all syria
and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them
and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee, and from decapolis, and from jerusalem, and from judaea, and from beyond jordan
and seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain
and when he was set, his disciples came unto him
and he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
blessed are the poor in spirit
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn
for they shall be comforted
blessed are the meek
for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness
for they shall be filled
blessed are the merciful
for they shall obtain mercy
blessed are the pure in heart
for they shall see god
blessed are the peacemakers
for they shall be called the children of god
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake
rejoice, and be exceeding glad
for great is your reward in heaven
for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
ye are the salt of the earth
but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men
ye are the light of the world
a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid
neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house
let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to destroy the law, or the prophets
i am not come to destroy, but to fulfil
for verily i say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled
whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven
but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
for i say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
but i say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment
and whosoever shall say to his brother, raca, shall be in danger of the council
but whosoever shall say, thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire
therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift
agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison
verily i say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery
but i say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
and if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee
for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
and if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee
for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
it hath been said, whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement
but i say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery
and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths
but i say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is gods throne
nor by the earth; for it is his footstool
neither by jerusalem; for it is the city of the great king
neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black
but let your communication be, yea, yea; nay, nay
for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil
ye have heard that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth
but i say unto you, that ye resist not evil
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also
and if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also
and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain
give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
ye have heard that it hath been said, thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy
but i say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven
for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
for if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
and if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?
be ye therefore perfect, even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them
otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven
therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men
verily i say unto you, they have their reward
but when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
that thine alms may be in secret
and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly
and when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men
verily i say unto you, they have their reward
but thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret; and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
but when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do
for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
be not ye therefore like unto them
for your father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him
after this manner therefore pray ye
our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors
and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever
amen
for if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also forgive you
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your father forgive your trespasses
moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance
for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast
verily i say unto you, they have their reward
but thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy father which is in secret
and thy father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly
lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal
for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also
the light of the body is the eye
if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light
but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness
if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
no man can serve two masters
for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other
ye cannot serve god and mammon
therefore i say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on
is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
behold the fowls of the air
for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly father feedeth them
are ye not much better than they?
which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
and why take ye thought for raiment? consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin
and yet i say unto you, that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
wherefore, if god so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, o ye of little faith?
therefore take no thought, saying, what shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or, wherewithal shall we be clothed?
 for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things
but seek ye first the kingdom of god, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you
take therefore no thought for the morrow
for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself
sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
judge not, that ye be not judged
for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged
and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
or how wilt thou say to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye
give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you
ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
if ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them
for this is the law and the prophets
enter ye in at the strait gate
for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat
because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it
beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves
ye shall know them by their fruits
do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire
wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
not every one that saith unto me, lord, lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
many will say to me in that day, lord, lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
and then will i profess unto them, i never knew you
depart from me, ye that work iniquity
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, i will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock
and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not
for it was founded upon a rock
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand
and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell
and great was the fall of it
and it came to pass, when jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine
for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes
when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him
and, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean
and jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, i will; be thou clean
and immediately his leprosy was cleansed
and jesus saith unto him, see thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that moses commanded, for a testimony unto them
and when jesus was entered into capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
and saying, lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented
and jesus saith unto him, i will come and heal him
the centurion answered and said, lord, i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof
but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed
for i am a man under authority, having soldiers under me
and i say to this man, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doeth it
when jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, verily i say unto you, i have not found so great faith, no, not in israel
and i say unto you, that many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with abraham, and isaac, and jacob, in the kingdom of heaven
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
and jesus said unto the centurion, go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee
and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour
and when jesus was come into peters house, he saw his wifes mother laid, and sick of a fever
and he touched her hand, and the fever left her
and she arose, and ministered unto them
when the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils
and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet, saying, himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses
now when jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side
and a certain scribe came, and said unto him, master, i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus saith unto him, the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and another of his disciples said unto him, lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father
but jesus said unto him, follow me; and let the dead bury their dead
and when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him
and, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves
but he was asleep
and his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, lord, save us
we perish
and he saith unto them, why are ye fearful, o ye of little faith? then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm
but the men marvelled, saying, what manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way
and, behold, they cried out, saying, what have we to do with thee, jesus, thou son of god? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding
so the devils besought him, saying, if thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine
and he said unto them, go
and when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine
and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters
and they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils
and, behold, the whole city came out to meet jesus
and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts
and he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city
and, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed
and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee
and, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, this man blasphemeth
and jesus knowing their thoughts said, wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
for whether is easier, to say, thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, arise, and walk?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,  arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house
and he arose, and departed to his house
but when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified god, which had given such power unto men
and as jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom
and he saith unto him, follow me
and he arose, and followed him
and it came to pass, as jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples
and when the pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, why eateth your master with publicans and sinners?
but when jesus heard that, he said unto them, they that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick
but go ye and learn what that meaneth, i will have mercy, and not sacrifice
for i am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance
then came to him the disciples of john, saying, why do we and the pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
and jesus said unto them, can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse
neither do men put new wine into old bottles
else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish
but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved
while he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, my daughter is even now dead
but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live
and jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples
and, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment
for she said within herself, if i may but touch his garment, i shall be whole
but jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole
and the woman was made whole from that hour
and when jesus came into the rulers house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
he said unto them, give place
for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn
but when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose
and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land
and when jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, thou son of david, have mercy on us
and when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him
and jesus saith unto them, believe ye that i am able to do this? they said unto him, yea, lord
then touched he their eyes, saying, according to your faith be it unto you
and their eyes were opened; and jesus straitly charged them, saying, see that no man know it
but they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country
as they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil
and when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake
and the multitudes marvelled, saying, it was never so seen in israel
but the pharisees said, he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils
and jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people
but when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd
then saith he unto his disciples, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease
now the names of the twelve apostles are these; the first, simon, who is called peter, and andrew his brother; james the son of zebedee, and john his brother;
philip, and bartholomew; thomas, and matthew the publican; james the son of alphaeus, and lebbaeus, whose surname was thaddaeus;
simon the canaanite, and judas iscariot, who also betrayed him
these twelve jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, go not into the way of the gentiles, and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
and as ye go, preach, saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand
heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils
freely ye have received, freely give
provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves
for the workman is worthy of his meat
and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence
and when ye come into an house, salute it
and if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it
but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you
and whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet
verily i say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city
behold, i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves
be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves
but beware of men
for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the gentiles
but when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak
for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak
for it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child
and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake
but he that endureth to the end shall be saved
but when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another
for verily i say unto you, ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel, till the son of man be come
the disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord
it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord
if they have called the master of the house beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?
fear them not therefore
for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known
what i tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light
and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops
and fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul
but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered
fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows
whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven
but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to send peace on earth
i came not to send peace, but a sword
for i am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law
and a mans foes shall be they of his own household
he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me
and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
and he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me
he that findeth his life shall lose it
and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it
he that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily i say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward
and it came to pass, when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities
now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ, he sent two of his disciples,
and said unto him, art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
jesus answered and said unto them, go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see
the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them
and blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me
and as they departed, jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john, what went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken with the wind?
but what went ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings houses
but what went ye out for to see? a prophet? yea, i say unto you, and more than a prophet
for this is he, of whom it is written, behold, i send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee
verily i say unto you, among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist
notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
and if ye will receive it, this is elias, which was for to come
he that hath ears to hear, let him hear
but whereunto shall i liken this generation? it is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,
and saying, we have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented
for john came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, he hath a devil
the son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners
but wisdom is justified of her children
then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not
woe unto thee, chorazin! woe unto thee, bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in tyre and sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
but i say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment, than for you
and thou, capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell
for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in sodom, it would have remained until this day
but i say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee
at that time jesus answered and said, i thank thee, o father, lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes
even so, father
for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered unto me of my father
and no man knoweth the son, but the father; neither knoweth any man the father, save the son, and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him
come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and i will give you rest
take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for i am meek and lowly in heart
and ye shall find rest unto your souls
for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light
at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat
but when the pharisees saw it, they said unto him, behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day
but he said unto them, have ye not read what david did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;
how he entered into the house of god, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?
or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
but i say unto you, that in this place is one greater than the temple
but if ye had known what this meaneth, i will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless
for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day
and when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue
and, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered
and they asked him, saying, is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him
and he said unto them, what man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
how much then is a man better than a sheep? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days
then saith he to the man, stretch forth thine hand
and he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other
then the pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him
but when jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence
and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
and charged them that they should not make him known
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet, saying,
behold my servant, whom i have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased
i will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles
he shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets
a bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory
and in his name shall the gentiles trust
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb
and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw
and all the people were amazed, and said, is not this the son of david?
but when the pharisees heard it, they said, this fellow doth not cast out devils, but by beelzebub the prince of the devils
and jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand
and if satan cast out satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges
but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god, then the kingdom of god is come unto you
or else how can one enter into a strong mans house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house
he that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad
wherefore i say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men
but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men
and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him
but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come
either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt
for the tree is known by his fruit
o generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things
and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
but i say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
for by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered, saying, master, we would see a sign from thee
but he answered and said unto them, an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet jonas
for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly; so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it
because they repented at the preaching of jonas; and, behold, a greater than jonas is here
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it
for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon; and, behold, a greater than solomon is here
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none
then he saith, i will return into my house from whence i came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished
then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there
and the last state of that man is worse than the first
even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
while he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him
then one said unto him, behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee
but he answered and said unto him that told him, who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, behold my mother and my brethren!
for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother
the same day went jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore
and he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, behold, a sower went forth to sow;
and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up
some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth
and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth
and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away
and some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them
but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold
who hath ears to hear, let him hear
and the disciples came, and said unto him, why speakest thou unto them in parables?
he answered and said unto them, because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given
for whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance
but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath
therefore speak i to them in parables
because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias, which saith, by hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive
for this peoples heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and i should heal them
but blessed are your eyes, for they see
and your ears, for they hear
for verily i say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them
hear ye therefore the parable of the sower
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart
this is he which received seed by the way side
but he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while
for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty
another parable put he forth unto them, saying, the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field
but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way
but when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also
so the servants of the householder came and said unto him, sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
he said unto them, an enemy hath done this
the servants said unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
but he said, nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them
let both grow together until the harvest
and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers, gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them
but gather the wheat into my barn
another parable put he forth unto them, saying, the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field
which indeed is the least of all seeds
but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof
another parable spake he unto them; the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened
all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, i will open my mouth in parables; i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world
then jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house
and his disciples came unto him, saying, declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field
he answered and said unto them, he that soweth the good seed is the son of man;
the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels
as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world
the son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
and shall cast them into a furnace of fire
there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father
who hath ears to hear, let him hear
again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field
again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls
who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it
again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind
which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away
so shall it be at the end of the world
the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire
there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
jesus saith unto them, have ye understood all these things? they say unto him, yea, lord
then said he unto them, therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old
and it came to pass, that when jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence
and when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
is not this the carpenters son? is not his mother called mary? and his brethren, james, and joses, and simon, and judas?
and his sisters, are they not all with us? whence then hath this man all these things?
and they were offended in him
but jesus said unto them, a prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house
and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief
at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus,
and said unto his servants, this is john the baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
for herod had laid hold on john, and bound him, and put him in prison for herodias sake, his brother philips wife
for john said unto him, it is not lawful for thee to have her
and when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet
but when herods birthday was kept, the daughter of herodias danced before them, and pleased herod
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask
and she, being before instructed of her mother, said, give me here john baptists head in a charger
and the king was sorry
nevertheless for the oaths sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her
and he sent, and beheaded john in the prison
and his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel
and she brought it to her mother
and his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told jesus
when jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart
and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities
and jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick
and when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, this is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals
but jesus said unto them, they need not depart; give ye them to eat
and they say unto him, we have here but five loaves, and two fishes
he said, bring them hither to me
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude
and they did all eat, and were filled
and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full
and they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children
and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away
and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray
and when the evening was come, he was there alone
but the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves
for the wind was contrary
and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them, walking on the sea
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, it is a spirit; and they cried out for fear
but straightway jesus spake unto them, saying, be of good cheer; it is i; be not afraid
and peter answered him and said, lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water
and he said, come
and when peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to jesus
but when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, lord, save me
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, o thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
and when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, of a truth thou art the son of god
and when they were gone over, they came into the land of gennesaret
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;
and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment
and as many as touched were made perfectly whole
then came to jesus scribes and pharisees, which were of jerusalem, saying,
why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread
but he answered and said unto them, why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition?
for god commanded, saying, honour thy father and mother
and, he that curseth father or mother, let him die the death
but ye say, whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, it is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free
thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition
ye hypocrites, well did esaias prophesy of you, saying,
this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me
but in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
and he called the multitude, and said unto them, hear, and understand
not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man
then came his disciples, and said unto him, knowest thou that the pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
but he answered and said, every plant, which my heavenly father hath not planted, shall be rooted up
let them alone
they be blind leaders of the blind
and if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch
then answered peter and said unto him, declare unto us this parable
and jesus said, are ye also yet without understanding?
do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man
for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies
these are the things which defile a man
but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man
then jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon
and, behold, a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, have mercy on me, o lord, thou son of david; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil
but he answered her not a word
and his disciples came and besought him, saying, send her away; for she crieth after us
but he answered and said, i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel
then came she and worshipped him, saying, lord, help me
but he answered and said, it is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to dogs
and she said, truth, lord
yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table
then jesus answered and said unto her, o woman, great is thy faith
be it unto thee even as thou wilt
and her daughter was made whole from that very hour
and jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there
and great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at jesus feet; and he healed them
insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see
and they glorified the god of israel
then jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, i have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat
and i will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way
and his disciples say unto him, whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
and jesus saith unto them, how many loaves have ye? and they said, seven, and a few little fishes
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude
and they did all eat, and were filled
and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full
and they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children
and he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of magdala,
the pharisees also with the sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven
he answered and said unto them, when it is evening, ye say, it will be fair weather
for the sky is red
and in the morning, it will be foul weather to day
for the sky is red and lowring
o ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?
a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet jonas
and he left them, and departed
and when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread
then jesus said unto them, take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees
and they reasoned among themselves, saying, it is because we have taken no bread
which when jesus perceived, he said unto them, o ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees?
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees
when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, whom do men say that i the son of man am?
and they said, some say that thou art john the baptist
some, elias; and others, jeremias, or one of the prophets
he saith unto them, but whom say ye that i am?
and simon peter answered and said, thou art the christ, the son of the living god
and jesus answered and said unto him, blessed art thou, simon barjona
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven
and i say also unto thee, that thou art peter, and upon this rock i will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ
from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day
then peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, be it far from thee, lord
this shall not be unto thee
but he turned, and said unto peter, get thee behind me, satan
thou art an offence unto me
for thou savourest not the things that be of god, but those that be of men
then said jesus unto his disciples, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it
and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it
for what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works
verily i say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
and after six days jesus taketh peter, james, and john his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
and was transfigured before them
and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light
and, behold, there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him
then answered peter, and said unto jesus, lord, it is good for us to be here
if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for moses, and one for elias
while he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them
and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased; hear ye him
and when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid
and jesus came and touched them, and said, arise, and be not afraid
and when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save jesus only
and as they came down from the mountain, jesus charged them, saying, tell the vision to no man, until the son of man be risen again from the dead
and his disciples asked him, saying, why then say the scribes that elias must first come?
and jesus answered and said unto them, elias truly shall first come, and restore all things
but i say unto you, that elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed
likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them
then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist
and when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
lord, have mercy on my son
for he is lunatick, and sore vexed
for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water
and i brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him
then jesus answered and said, o faithless and perverse generation, how long shall i be with you? how long shall i suffer you? bring him hither to me
and jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him
and the child was cured from that very hour
then came the disciples to jesus apart, and said, why could not we cast him out?
and jesus said unto them, because of your unbelief
for verily i say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you
howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting
and while they abode in galilee, jesus said unto them, the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men
and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again
and they were exceeding sorry
and when they were come to capernaum, they that received tribute money came to peter, and said, doth not your master pay tribute?
he saith, yes
and when he was come into the house, jesus prevented him, saying, what thinkest thou, simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?
peter saith unto him, of strangers
jesus saith unto him, then are the children free
notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money
that take, and give unto them for me and thee
at the same time came the disciples unto jesus, saying, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
and jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
and said, verily i say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee
it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire
and if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee
it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for i say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven
for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
how think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
and if so be that he find it, verily i say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray
even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish
moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone
if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother
but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church
but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican
verily i say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
again i say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven
for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am i in the midst of them
then came peter to him, and said, lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and i forgive him? till seven times?
jesus saith unto him, i say not unto thee, until seven times
but, until seventy times seven
therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants
and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents
but forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made
the servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, lord, have patience with me, and i will pay thee all
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt
but the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence
and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, pay me that thou owest
and his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, have patience with me, and i will pay thee all
and he would not
but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt
so when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done
then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, o thou wicked servant, i forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me
shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as i had pity on thee?
and his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him
so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
and it came to pass, that when jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from galilee, and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan;
and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there
the pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
and he answered and said unto them, have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
and said, for this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife
and they twain shall be one flesh?
wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh
what therefore god hath joined together, let not man put asunder
they say unto him, why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
he saith unto them, moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives
but from the beginning it was not so
and i say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery
and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
his disciples say unto him, if the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry
but he said unto them, all men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given
for there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mothers womb
and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men
and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake
he that is able to receive it, let him receive it
then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray
and the disciples rebuked them
but jesus said, suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me
for of such is the kingdom of heaven
and he laid his hands on them, and departed thence
and, behold, one came and said unto him, good master, what good thing shall i do, that i may have eternal life?
and he said unto him, why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, god
but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments
he saith unto him, which? jesus said, thou shalt do no murder, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness,
honour thy father and thy mother
and, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
the young man saith unto him, all these things have i kept from my youth up
what lack i yet?
jesus said unto him, if thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
and come and follow me
but when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful
for he had great possessions
then said jesus unto his disciples, verily i say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
and again i say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
when his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, who then can be saved?
but jesus beheld them, and said unto them, with men this is impossible; but with god all things are possible
then answered peter and said unto him, behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
and jesus said unto them, verily i say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of israel
and every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life
but many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard
and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard
and he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
and said unto them; go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right i will give you
and they went their way
again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise
and about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, why stand ye here all the day idle?
they say unto him, because no man hath hired us
he saith unto them, go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive
so when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first
and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny
but when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny
and when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
saying, these last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day
but he answered one of them, and said, friend, i do thee no wrong
didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
take that thine is, and go thy way
i will give unto this last, even as unto thee
is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own? is thine eye evil, because i am good?
so the last shall be first, and the first last
for many be called, but few chosen
and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
behold, we go up to jerusalem; and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him
and the third day he shall rise again
then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him
and he said unto her, what wilt thou? she saith unto him, grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom
but jesus answered and said, ye know not what ye ask
are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with? they say unto him, we are able
and he saith unto them, ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with
but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father
and when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren
but jesus called them unto him, and said, ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them
but it shall not be so among you
but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant
even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many
and as they departed from jericho, a great multitude followed him
and, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that jesus passed by, cried out, saying, have mercy on us, o lord, thou son of david
and the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace
but they cried the more, saying, have mercy on us, o lord, thou son of david
and jesus stood still, and called them, and said, what will ye that i shall do unto you?
they say unto him, lord, that our eyes may be opened
so jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes
and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him
and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem, and were come to bethphage, unto the mount of olives, then sent jesus two disciples,
saying unto them, go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her
loose them, and bring them unto me
and if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, the lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them
all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
tell ye the daughter of sion, behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass
and the disciples went, and did as jesus commanded them,
and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon
and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way
and the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, hosanna to the son of david
blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord; hosanna in the highest
and when he was come into jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, who is this?
and the multitude said, this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee
and jesus went into the temple of god, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
and said unto them, it is written, my house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, hosanna to the son of david; they were sore displeased,
and said unto him, hearest thou what these say? and jesus saith unto them, yea; have ye never read, out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
and he left them, and went out of the city into bethany; and he lodged there
now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered
and when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever
and presently the fig tree withered away
and when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, how soon is the fig tree withered away!
jesus answered and said unto them, verily i say unto you, if ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done
and all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive
and when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, by what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
and jesus answered and said unto them, i also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? and they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall say, from heaven; he will say unto us, why did ye not then believe him?
but if we shall say, of men; we fear the people; for all hold john as a prophet
and they answered jesus, and said, we cannot tell
and he said unto them, neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
but what think ye? a certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, son, go work to day in my vineyard
he answered and said, i will not
but afterward he repented, and went
and he came to the second, and said likewise
and he answered and said, i go, sir
and went not
whether of them twain did the will of his father? they say unto him, the first
jesus saith unto them, verily i say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you
for john came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not
but the publicans and the harlots believed him
and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him
hear another parable
there was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country
and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it
and the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another
again, he sent other servants more than the first
and they did unto them likewise
but last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, they will reverence my son
but when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, this is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance
and they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him
when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
they say unto him, he will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons
jesus saith unto them, did ye never read in the scriptures, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner
this is the lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
therefore say i unto you, the kingdom of god shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken
but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder
and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them
but when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet
and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding
and they would not come
again, he sent forth other servants, saying, tell them which are bidden, behold, i have prepared my dinner
my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready
come unto the marriage
but they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise
and the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them
but when the king heard thereof, he was wroth
and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city
then saith he to his servants, the wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy
go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage
so those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good
and the wedding was furnished with guests
and when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment
and he saith unto him, friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? and he was speechless
then said the king to the servants, bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
for many are called, but few are chosen
then went the pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk
and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians, saying, master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of god in truth, neither carest thou for any man
for thou regardest not the person of men
tell us therefore, what thinkest thou? is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar, or not?
but jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
shew me the tribute money
and they brought unto him a penny
and he saith unto them, whose is this image and superscription?
they say unto him, caesars
then saith he unto them, render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars; and unto god the things that are gods
when they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way
the same day came to him the sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
saying, master, moses said, if a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother
now there were with us seven brethren
and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother
likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh
and last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her
jesus answered and said unto them, ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of god
for in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of god in heaven
but as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god, saying,
i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob? god is not the god of the dead, but of the living
and when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine
but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence, they were gathered together
then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
master, which is the great commandment in the law?
jesus said unto him, thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind
this is the first and great commandment
and the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
while the pharisees were gathered together, jesus asked them,
saying, what think ye of christ? whose son is he? they say unto him, the son of david
he saith unto them, how then doth david in spirit call him lord, saying,
the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine enemies thy footstool?
if david then call him lord, how is he his son?
and no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions
then spake jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
saying, the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat
all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works
for they say, and do not
for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on mens shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
but all their works they do for to be seen of men
they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, rabbi, rabbi
but be not ye called rabbi
for one is your master, even christ; and all ye are brethren
and call no man your father upon the earth
for one is your father, which is in heaven
neither be ye called masters
for one is your master, even christ
but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted
but woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men
for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayer
therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
ye fools and blind
for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
and, whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty
ye fools and blind
for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon
and whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein
and he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of god, and by him that sitteth thereon
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith
these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone
ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess
thou blind pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanness
even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
and say, if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets
wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets
fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
wherefore, behold, i send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes
and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar
verily i say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation
o jerusalem, jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would i have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
behold, your house is left unto you desolate
for i say unto you, ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus went out, and departed from the temple
and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple
and jesus said unto them, see ye not all these things? verily i say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
and jesus answered and said unto them, take heed that no man deceive you
for many shall come in my name, saying, i am christ; and shall deceive many
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars
see that ye be not troubled
for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet
for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places
all these are the beginning of sorrows
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you
and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake
and then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another
and many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many
and because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold
but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, 
then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains
let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house
neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes
and woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day
for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be
and except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved
but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened
then if any man shall say unto you, lo, here is christ, or there; believe it not
for there shall arise false christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect
behold, i have told you before
wherefore if they shall say unto you, behold, he is in the desert; go not forth
behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not
for as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the son of man be
for wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven
and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other
now learn a parable of the fig tree; when his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh
so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors
verily i say unto you, this generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away
but of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my father only
but as the days of noe were, so shall also the coming of the son of man be
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that noe entered into the ark,
and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the son of man be
then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left
two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left
watch therefore
for ye know not what hour your lord doth come
but know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up
therefore be ye also ready
for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh
who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
verily i say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods
but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming;
and shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom
and five of them were wise, and five were foolish
they that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept
and at midnight there was a cry made, behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him
then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps
and the foolish said unto the wise, give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out
but the wise answered, saying, not so; lest there be not enough for us and you
but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves
and while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage
and the door was shut
afterward came also the other virgins, saying, lord, lord, open to us
but he answered and said, verily i say unto you, i know you not
watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods
and unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents
and likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two
but he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lords money
after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents
behold, i have gained beside them five talents more
his lord said unto him, well done, thou good and faithful servant
thou hast been faithful over a few things, i will make thee ruler over many things
enter thou into the joy of thy lord
he also that had received two talents came and said, lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents
behold, i have gained two other talents beside them
his lord said unto him, well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, i will make thee ruler over many things
enter thou into the joy of thy lord
then he which had received the one talent came and said, lord, i knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed
and i was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth
lo, there thou hast that is thine
his lord answered and said unto him, thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not, and gather where i have not strawed
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury
take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents
for unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance
but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
when the son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory
and before him shall be gathered all nations
and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left
then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, come, ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
for i was an hungred, and ye gave me meat
i was thirsty, and ye gave me drink
i was a stranger, and ye took me in
naked, and ye clothed me
i was sick, and ye visited me
i was in prison, and ye came unto me
then shall the righteous answer him, saying, lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
and the king shall answer and say unto them, verily i say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me
then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels
for i was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat
i was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink
i was a stranger, and ye took me not in
naked, and ye clothed me not
sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not
then shall they also answer him, saying, lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
then shall he answer them, saying, verily i say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me
and these shall go away into everlasting punishment
but the righteous into life eternal
and it came to pass, when jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified
then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called caiaphas,
and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty, and kill him
but they said, not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people
now when jesus was in bethany, in the house of simon the leper,
there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat
but when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, to what purpose is this waste?
for this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor
when jesus understood it, he said unto them, why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me
for ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always
for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial
verily i say unto you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her
then one of the twelve, called judas iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
and said unto them, what will ye give me, and i will deliver him unto you? and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver
and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus, saying unto him, where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
and he said, go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, the master saith, my time is at hand; i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples
and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover
now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve
and as they did eat, he said, verily i say unto you, that one of you shall betray me
and they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, lord, is it i?
and he answered and said, he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me
the son of man goeth as it is written of him
but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born
then judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, master, is it i? he said unto him, thou hast said
and as they were eating, jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, take, eat; this is my body
and he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, drink ye all of it;
for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins
but i say unto you, i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom
and when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of olives
then saith jesus unto them, all ye shall be offended because of me this night
for it is written, i will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad
but after i am risen again, i will go before you into galilee
peter answered and said unto him, though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will i never be offended
jesus said unto him, verily i say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice
peter said unto him, though i should die with thee, yet will i not deny thee
likewise also said all the disciples
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, sit ye here, while i go and pray yonder
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
then saith he unto them, my soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death
tarry ye here, and watch with me
and he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, o my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me
nevertheless not as i will, but as thou wilt
and he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto peter, what, could ye not watch with me one hour?
watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation
the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak
he went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, o my father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except i drink it, thy will be done
and he came and found them asleep again
for their eyes were heavy
and he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words
then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, sleep on now, and take your rest
behold, the hour is at hand, and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise, let us be going
behold, he is at hand that doth betray me
and while he yet spake, lo, judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, whomsoever i shall kiss, that same is he
hold him fast
and forthwith he came to jesus, and said, hail, master; and kissed him
and jesus said unto him, friend, wherefore art thou come? then came they, and laid hands on jesus, and took him
and, behold, one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priests, and smote off his ear
then said jesus unto him, put up again thy sword into his place
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes, are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? i sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me
but all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled
then all the disciples forsook him, and fled
and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled
but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end
now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against jesus, to put him to death;
but found none
yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none
at the last came two false witnesses,
and said, this fellow said, i am able to destroy the temple of god, and to build it in three days
and the high priest arose, and said unto him, answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
but jesus held his peace
and the high priest answered and said unto him, i adjure thee by the living god, that thou tell us whether thou be the christ, the son of god
jesus saith unto him, thou hast said
nevertheless i say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, he hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy
what think ye? they answered and said, he is guilty of death
then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,
saying, prophesy unto us, thou christ, who is he that smote thee?
now peter sat without in the palace
and a damsel came unto him, saying, thou also wast with jesus of galilee
but he denied before them all, saying, i know not what thou sayest
and when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth
and again he denied with an oath, i do not know the man
and after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to peter, surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee
then began he to curse and to swear, saying, i know not the man
and immediately the cock crew
and peter remembered the word of jesus, which said unto him, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice
and he went out, and wept bitterly
when the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death
and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor
then judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
saying, i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood
and they said, what is that to us? see thou to that
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself
and the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood
and they took counsel, and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in
wherefore that field was called, the field of blood, unto this day
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet, saying, and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of israel did value;
and gave them for the potters field, as the lord appointed me
and jesus stood before the governor
and the governor asked him, saying, art thou the king of the jews? and jesus said unto him, thou sayest
and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing
then said pilate unto him, hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
and he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would
and they had then a notable prisoner, called barabbas
therefore when they were gathered together, pilate said unto them, whom will ye that i release unto you? barabbas, or jesus which is called christ?
for he knew that for envy they had delivered him
when he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, have thou nothing to do with that just man
for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas, and destroy jesus
the governor answered and said unto them, whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you? they said, barabbas
pilate saith unto them, what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ? they all say unto him, let him be crucified
and the governor said, why, what evil hath he done? but they cried out the more, saying, let him be crucified
when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, i am innocent of the blood of this just person
see ye to it
then answered all the people, and said, his blood be on us, and on our children
then released he barabbas unto them
and when he had scourged jesus, he delivered him to be crucified
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers
and they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe
and when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand
and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, hail, king of the jews!
and they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head
and after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him
and as they came out, they found a man of cyrene, simon by name
him they compelled to bear his cross
and when they were come unto a place called golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall
and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink
and they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, they parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots
and sitting down they watched him there;
and set up over his head his accusation written, this is jesus the king of the jews
then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left
and they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
and saying, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself
if thou be the son of god, come down from the cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
he saved others; himself he cannot save
if he be the king of israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him
he trusted in god; let him deliver him now, if he will have him
for he said, i am the son of god
the thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour
and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, eli, eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, my god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?
some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, this man calleth for elias
and straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink
the rest said, let be, let us see whether elias will come to save him
jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost
and, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many
now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, truly this was the son of god
and many women were there beholding afar off, which followed jesus from galilee, ministering unto him
among which was mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james and joses, and the mother of zebedees children
when the even was come, there came a rich man of arimathaea, named joseph, who also himself was jesus disciple
he went to pilate, and begged the body of jesus
then pilate commanded the body to be delivered
and when joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock
and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed
and there was mary magdalene, and the other mary, sitting over against the sepulchre
now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate,
saying, sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, after three days i will rise again
command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, he is risen from the dead
so the last error shall be worse than the first
pilate said unto them, ye have a watch
go your way, make it as sure as ye can
so they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch
in the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre
and, behold, there was a great earthquake
for the angel of the lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it
his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow
and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men
and the angel answered and said unto the women, fear not ye
for i know that ye seek jesus, which was crucified
he is not here
for he is risen, as he said
come, see the place where the lord lay
and go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into galilee; there shall ye see him
lo, i have told you
and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word
and as they went to tell his disciples, behold, jesus met them, saying, all hail
and they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him
then said jesus unto them, be not afraid
go tell my brethren that they go into galilee, and there shall they see me
now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done
and when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
saying, say ye, his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept
and if this come to the governors ears, we will persuade him, and secure you
so they took the money, and did as they were taught
and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day
then the eleven disciples went away into galilee, into a mountain where jesus had appointed them
and when they saw him, they worshipped him
but some doubted
and jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you
and, lo, i am with you alway, even unto the end of the world
amen
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ, the son of god;
as it is written in the prophets, behold, i send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee
the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the lord, make his paths straight
john did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
and there went out unto him all the land of judaea, and they of jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan, confessing their sins
and john was clothed with camels hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
and preached, saying, there cometh one mightier than i after me, the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
i indeed have baptized you with water
but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in those days, that jesus came from nazareth of galilee, and was baptized of john in jordan
and straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the spirit like a dove descending upon him
and there came a voice from heaven, saying, thou art my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased
and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness
and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him
now after that john was put in prison, jesus came into galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god,
and saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of god is at hand
repent ye, and believe the gospel
now as he walked by the sea of galilee, he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea
for they were fishers
and jesus said unto them, come ye after me, and i will make you to become fishers of men
and straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him
and when he had gone a little further thence, he saw james the son of zebedee, and john his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets
and straightway he called them
and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him
and they went into capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught
and they were astonished at his doctrine
for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes
and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
saying, let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou jesus of nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? i know thee who thou art, the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him, saying, hold thy peace, and come out of him
and when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him
and they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, what thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him
and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee
and forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of simon and andrew, with james and john
but simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her
and he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them
and at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils
and all the city was gathered together at the door
and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him
and in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed
and simon and they that were with him followed after him
and when they had found him, they said unto him, all men seek for thee
and he said unto them, let us go into the next towns, that i may preach there also
for therefore came i forth
and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee, and cast out devils
and there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean
and jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, i will; be thou clean
and as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed
and he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
and saith unto him, see thou say nothing to any man
but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded, for a testimony unto them
but he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places
and they came to him from every quarter
and again he entered into capernaum, after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house
and straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door
and he preached the word unto them
and they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was
and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay
when jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, son, thy sins be forgiven thee
but there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but god only?
and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, why reason ye these things in your hearts?
whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, 
i say unto thee, arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house
and immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified god, saying, we never saw it on this fashion
and he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them
and as he passed by, he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, follow me
and he arose and followed him
and it came to pass, that, as jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples
for there were many, and they followed him
and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
when jesus heard it, he saith unto them, they that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick
i came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance
and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast
and they come and say unto him, why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
and jesus said unto them, can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast
but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment
else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles
else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred
but new wine must be put into new bottles
and it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn
and the pharisees said unto him, behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
and he said unto them, have ye never read what david did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?
how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
and he said unto them, the sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath
therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand
and they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him
and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, stand forth
and he saith unto them, is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? but they held their peace
and when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, stretch forth thine hand
and he stretched it out
and his hand was restored whole as the other
and the pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him, how they might destroy him
but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea
and a great multitude from galilee followed him, and from judaea,
and from jerusalem, and from idumaea, and from beyond jordan; and they about tyre and sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him
and he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him
for he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues
and unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, thou art the son of god
and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known
and he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would
and they came unto him
and he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils
and simon he surnamed peter;
and james the son of zebedee, and john the brother of james; and he surnamed them boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder
and andrew, and philip, and bartholomew, and matthew, and thomas, and james the son of alphaeus, and thaddaeus, and simon the canaanite,
and judas iscariot, which also betrayed him
and they went into an house
and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread
and when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him
for they said, he is beside himself
and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said, he hath beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils
and he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, how can satan cast out satan?
and if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand
and if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand
and if satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end
no man can enter into a strong mans house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house
verily i say unto you, all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme
but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation
because they said, he hath an unclean spirit
there came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him
and the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee
and he answered them, saying, who is my mother, or my brethren?
and he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, behold my mother and my brethren!
for whosoever shall do the will of god, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother
and he began again to teach by the sea side
and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land
and he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
hearken; behold, there went out a sower to sow
and it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up
and some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth
but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away
and some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit
and other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred
and he said unto them, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear
and when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable
and he said unto them, unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god
but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables
that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them
and he said unto them, know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
the sower soweth the word
and these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts
and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
and have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time
afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake, immediately they are offended
and these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful
and these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred
and he said unto them, is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
for there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad
if any man have ears to hear, let him hear
and he said unto them, take heed what ye hear
with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you
and unto you that hear shall more be given
for he that hath, to him shall be given
and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath
and he said, so is the kingdom of god, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how
for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear
but when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come
and he said, whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
it is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
but when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it
but without a parable spake he not unto them
and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples
and the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, let us pass over unto the other side
and when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship
and there were also with him other little ships
and there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full
and he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow
and they awake him, and say unto him, master, carest thou not that we perish?
and he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, peace, be still
and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm
and he said unto them, why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
and they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, what manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
and they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the gadarenes
and when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces
neither could any man tame him
and always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones
but when he saw jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
and cried with a loud voice, and said, what have i to do with thee, jesus, thou son of the most high god? i adjure thee by god, that thou torment me not
for he said unto him, come out of the man, thou unclean spirit
and he asked him, what is thy name? and he answered, saying, my name is legion
for we are many
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country
now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding
and all the devils besought him, saying, send us into the swine, that we may enter into them
and forthwith jesus gave them leave
and the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine
and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea,  and were choked in the sea
and they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country
and they went out to see what it was that was done
and they come to jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind
and they were afraid
and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine
and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts
and when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him
howbeit jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee
and he departed, and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him
and all men did marvel
and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him
and he was nigh unto the sea
and, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
and besought him greatly, saying, my little daughter lieth at the point of death
i pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live
and jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him
and a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
when she had heard of jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment
for she said, if i may touch but his clothes, i shall be whole
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague
and jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, who touched my clothes?
and his disciples said unto him, thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, who touched me?
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing
but the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth
and he said unto her, daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague
while he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogues house certain which said, thy daughter is dead
why troublest thou the master any further?
as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, be not afraid, only believe
and he suffered no man to follow him, save peter, and james, and john the brother of james
and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly
and when he was come in, he saith unto them, why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn
but when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying
and he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, damsel, i say unto thee, arise
and straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years
and they were astonished with a great astonishment
and he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat
and he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him
and when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue
and many hearing him were astonished, saying, from whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
is not this the carpenter, the son of mary, the brother of james, and joses, and of juda, and simon? and are not his sisters here with us? and they were offended at him
but jesus said unto them, a prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house
and he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them
and he marvelled because of their unbelief
and he went round about the villages, teaching
and he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse
but be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats
and he said unto them, in what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place
and whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them
verily i say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city
and they went out, and preached that men should repent
and they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them
and king herod heard of him;  and he said, that john the baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
others said, that it is elias
and others said, that it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets
but when herod heard thereof, he said, it is john, whom i beheaded
he is risen from the dead
for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john, and bound him in prison for herodias sake, his brother philips wife
for he had married her
for john had said unto herod, it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife
therefore herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not
for herod feared john, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly
and when a convenient day was come, that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of galilee;
and when the daughter of the said herodias came in, and danced, and pleased herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and i will give it thee
and he sware unto her, whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, i will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom
and she went forth, and said unto her mother, what shall i ask? and she said, the head of john the baptist
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist
and the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oaths sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her
and immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought
and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel
and the damsel gave it to her mother
and when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught
and he said unto them, come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while
for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat
and they departed into a desert place by ship privately
and the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him
and jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd
and he began to teach them many things
and when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, this is a desert place, and now the time is far passed
send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread
for they have nothing to eat
he answered and said unto them, give ye them to eat
and they say unto him, shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
he saith unto them, how many loaves have ye? go and see
and when they knew, they say, five, and two fishes
and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass
and they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all
and they did all eat, and were filled
and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes
and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida, while he sent away the people
and when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray
and when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land
and he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them
and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them
but when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out
for they all saw him, and were troubled
and immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, be of good cheer
it is i; be not afraid
and he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased
and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered
for they considered not the miracle of the loaves
for their heart was hardened
and when they had passed over, they came into the land of gennesaret, and drew to the shore
and when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
and ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was
and whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment
and as many as touched him were made whole
then came together unto him the pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from jerusalem
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault
for the pharisees, and all the jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders
and when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not
and many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables
then the pharisees and scribes asked him, why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
he answered and said unto them, well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, this people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me
howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctines the commandments of men
for laying aside the commandment of god, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups
and many other such like things ye do
and he said unto them, full well ye reject the commandment of god, that ye may keep your own tradition
for moses said, honour thy father and thy mother; and, whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death
but ye say, if a man shall say to his father or mother, it is corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free
and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
making the word of god of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered
and many such like things do ye
and when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, hearken unto me every one of you, and understand
there is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him
but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man
if any man have ears to hear, let him hear
and when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable
and he saith unto them, are ye so without understanding also? do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;
because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
and he said, that which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man
for from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness
all these evil things come from within, and defile the man
and from thence he arose, and went into the borders of tyre and sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it
but he could not be hid
for a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet
the woman was a greek, a syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter
but jesus said unto her, let the children first be filled
for it is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to cast it unto the dogs
and she answered and said unto him, yes, lord
yet the dogs under the table eat of the childrens crumbs
and he said unto her, for this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter
and when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed
and again, departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon, he came unto the sea of galilee, through the midst of the coasts of decapolis
and they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him
and he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, ephphatha, that is, be opened
and straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain
and he charged them that they should tell no man
but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
and were beyond measure astonished, saying, he hath done all things well
he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak
in those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,
i have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat
and if i send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way
for divers of them came from far
and his disciples answered him, from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
and he asked them, how many loaves have ye? and they said, seven
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground
and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people
and they had a few small fishes
and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them
so they did eat, and were filled
and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets
and they that had eaten were about four thousand
and he sent them away
and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of dalmanutha
and the pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him
and he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily i say unto you, there shall no sign be given unto this generation
and he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side
now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf
and he charged them, saying, take heed, beware of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of herod
and they reasoned among themselves, saying, it is because we have no bread
and when jesus knew it, he saith unto them, why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
when i brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? they say unto him, twelve
and when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? and they said, seven
and he said unto them, how is it that ye do not understand?
and he cometh to bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him
and he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought
and he looked up, and said, i see men as trees, walking
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up
and he was restored, and saw every man clearly
and he sent him away to his house, saying, neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town
and jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of caesarea philippi
and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, whom do men say that i am?
and they answered, john the baptist
but some say, elias; and others, one of the prophets
and he saith unto them, but whom say ye that i am? and peter answereth and saith unto him, thou art the christ
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him
and he began to teach them, that the son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again
and he spake that saying openly
and peter took him, and began to rebuke him
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked peter, saying, get thee behind me, satan
for thou savourest not the things that be of god, but the things that be of men
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels, the same shall save it
for what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels
and he said unto them, verily i say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter, and james, and john, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves
and he was transfigured before them
and his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them
and there appeared unto them elias with moses
and they were talking with jesus
and peter answered and said to jesus, master, it is good for us to be here
and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for moses, and one for elias
for he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid
and there was a cloud that overshadowed them
and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, this is my beloved son
hear him
and suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save jesus only with themselves
and as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the son of man were risen from the dead
and they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean
and they asked him, saying, why say the scribes that elias must first come?
and he answered and told them, elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought
but i say unto you, that elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him
and when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them
and straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him
and he asked the scribes, what question ye with them?
and one of the multitude answered and said, master, i have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him
and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away
and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not
he answereth him, and saith, o faithless generation, how long shall i be with you? how long shall i suffer you? bring him unto me
and they brought him unto him
and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming
and he asked his father, how long is it ago since this came unto him? and he said, of a child
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him
but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us
jesus said unto him, if thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth
and straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, lord, i believe; help thou mine unbelief
when jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, thou dumb and deaf spirit, i charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him
and the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him
and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, he is dead
but jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose
and when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, why could not we cast him out?
and he said unto them, this kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting
and they departed thence, and passed through galilee; and he would not that any man should know it
for he taught his disciples, and said unto them, the son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day
but they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him
and he came to capernaum
and being in the house he asked them, what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
but they held their peace
for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest
and he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, if any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all
and he took a child, and set him in the midst of them
and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me
and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me
and john answered him, saying, master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us
and we forbad him, because he followeth not us
but jesus said, forbid him not
for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me
for he that is not against us is on our part
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to christ, verily i say unto you, he shall not lose his reward
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea
and if thy hand offend thee, cut it off
it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched
and if thy foot offend thee, cut it off
it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched
and if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out
it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched
for every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt
salt is good
but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another
and he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan
and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again
and the pharisees came to him, and asked him, is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him
and he answered and said unto them, what did moses command you?
and they said, moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away
and jesus answered and said unto them, for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept
but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
and they twain shall be one flesh
so then they are no more twain, but one flesh
what therefore god hath joined together, let not man put asunder
and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter
and he saith unto them, whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her
and if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery
and they brought young children to him, that he should touch them
and his disciples rebuked those that brought them
but when jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not
for of such is the kingdom of god
verily i say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child, he shall not enter therein
and he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them
and when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, good master, what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life?
and jesus said unto him, why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, god
thou knowest the commandments, do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, defraud not, honour thy father and mother
and he answered and said unto him, master, all these have i observed from my youth
then jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, one thing thou lackest
go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
and come, take up the cross, and follow me
and he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved
for he had great possessions
and jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god!
and the disciples were astonished at his words
but jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god!
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, who then can be saved?
and jesus looking upon them saith, with men it is impossible, but not with god
for with god all things are possible
then peter began to say unto him, lo, we have left all, and have followed thee
and jesus answered and said, verily i say unto you, there is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospels,
but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life
but many that are first shall be last; and the last first
and they were in the way going up to jerusalem; and jesus went before them
and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid
and he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
saying, behold, we go up to jerusalem; and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the gentiles
and they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him
and the third day he shall rise again
and james and john, the sons of zebedee, come unto him, saying, master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire
and he said unto them, what would ye that i should do for you?
they said unto him, grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory
but jesus said unto them, ye know not what ye ask
can ye drink of the cup that i drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with?
and they said unto him, we can
and jesus said unto them, ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of; and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared
and when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with james and john
but jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them
but so shall it not be among you
but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister
and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all
for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many
and they came to jericho
and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind bartimaeus, the son of timaeus, sat by the highway side begging
and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, jesus, thou son of david, have mercy on me
and many charged him that he should hold his peace
but he cried the more a great deal, thou son of david, have mercy on me
and jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called
and they call the blind man, saying unto him, be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee
and he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to jesus
and jesus answered and said unto him, what wilt thou that i should do unto thee? the blind man said unto him, lord, that i might receive my sight
and jesus said unto him, go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole
and immediately he received his sight, and followed jesus in the way
and when they came nigh to jerusalem, unto bethphage and bethany, at the mount of olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
and saith unto them, go your way into the village over against you
and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him
and if any man say unto you, why do ye this? say ye that the lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither
and they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him
and certain of them that stood there said unto them, what do ye, loosing the colt?
and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded
and they let them go
and they brought the colt to jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him
and many spread their garments in the way
and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way
and they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, hosanna; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
blessed be the kingdom of our father david, that cometh in the name of the lord
hosanna in the highest
and jesus entered into jerusalem, and into the temple
and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto bethany with the twelve
and on the morrow, when they were come from bethany, he was hungry
and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon
and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet
and jesus answered and said unto it, no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever
and his disciples heard it
and they come to jerusalem
and jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple
and he taught, saying unto them, is it not written, my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves
and the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him
for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine
and when even was come, he went out of the city
and in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away
and jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in god
for verily i say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith
therefore i say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them
and when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any
that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
but if ye do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses
and they come again to jerusalem
and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
and say unto him, by what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
and jesus answered and said unto them, i will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and i will tell you by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me
and they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall say, from heaven; he will say, why then did ye not believe him?
but if we shall say, of men; they feared the people
for all men counted john, that he was a prophet indeed
and they answered and said unto jesus, we cannot tell
and jesus answering saith unto them, neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things
and he began to speak unto them by parables
a certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
and they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty
and again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled
and again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some
having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, they will reverence my son
but those husbandmen said among themselves, this is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours
and they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard
what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others
and have ye not read this scripture; the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner
this was the lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
and they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people
for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them
and they left him, and went their way
and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians, to catch him in his words
and when they were come, they say unto him, master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man
for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of god in truth
is it lawful to give tribute to caesar, or not?
shall we give, or shall we not give? but he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that i may see it
and they brought it
and he saith unto them, whose is this image and superscription? and they said unto him, caesars
and jesus answering said unto them, render to caesar the things that are caesars, and to god the things that are gods
and they marvelled at him
then come unto him the sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
master, moses wrote unto us, if a mans brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother
now there were seven brethren
and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed
and the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed
and the third likewise
and the seven had her, and left no seed
last of all the woman died also
in the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them, do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of god?
for when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven
and as touching the dead, that they rise
have ye not read in the book of moses, how in the bush god spake unto him, saying, i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob?
he is not the god of the dead, but the god of the living
ye therefore do greatly err
and one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, which is the first commandment of all?
and jesus answered him, the first of all the commandments is, hear, o israel; the lord our god is one lord
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength
this is the first commandment
and the second is like, namely this, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
there is none other commandment greater than these
and the scribe said unto him, well, master, thou hast said the truth
for there is one god; and there is none other but he
and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, thou art not far from the kingdom of god
and no man after that durst ask him any question
and jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, how say the scribes that christ is the son of david?
for david himself said by the holy ghost, the lord said to my lord, sit thou on my right hand, till i make thine enemies thy footstool
david therefore himself calleth him lord; and whence is he then his son? and the common people heard him gladly
and he said unto them in his doctrine, beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,
and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts
which devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayers
these shall receive greater damnation
and jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury
and many that were rich cast in much
and there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing
and he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, verily i say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury
for all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living
and as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
and jesus answering said unto him, seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple, peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately,
tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
and jesus answering them began to say, take heed lest any man deceive you
for many shall come in my name, saying, i am christ; and shall deceive many
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled
for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet
for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles
these are the beginnings of sorrows
but take heed to yourselves
for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten
and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them
and the gospel must first be published among all nations
but when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate
but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye
for it is not ye that speak, but the holy ghost
now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake
but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not,  then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment
but woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
for in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time, neither shall be
and except that the lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved
but for the elects sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days
and then if any man shall say to you, lo, here is christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not
for false christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect
but take ye heed
behold, i have foretold you all things
but in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
and the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
and then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven
now learn a parable of the fig tree; when her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near
so ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors
verily i say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done
heaven and earth shall pass away
but my words shall not pass away
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the son, but the father
take ye heed, watch and pray
for ye know not when the time is
for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch
watch ye therefore
for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping
and what i say unto you i say unto all, watch
after two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death
but they said, not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people
and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head
and there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, why was this waste of the ointment made?
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor
and they murmured against her
and jesus said, let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me
for ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good
but me ye have not always
she hath done what she could
she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying
verily i say unto you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her
and judas iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them
and when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money
and he sought how he might conveniently betray him
and the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water
follow him
and wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, the master saith, where is the guestchamber, where i shall eat the passover with my disciples?
and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared
there make ready for us
and his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them
and they made ready the passover
and in the evening he cometh with the twelve
and as they sat and did eat, jesus said, verily i say unto you, one of you which eateth with me shall betray me
and they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, is it i? and another said, is it i?
and he answered and said unto them, it is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish
the son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him
but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born
and as they did eat, jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, take, eat
this is my body
and he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them
and they all drank of it
and he said unto them, this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many
verily i say unto you, i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god
and when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of olives
and jesus saith unto them, all ye shall be offended because of me this night
for it is written, i will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered
but after that i am risen, i will go before you into galilee
but peter said unto him, although all shall be offended, yet will not i
and jesus saith unto him, verily i say unto thee, that this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice
but he spake the more vehemently, if i should die with thee, i will not deny thee in any wise
likewise also said they all
and they came to a place which was named gethsemane
and he saith to his disciples, sit ye here, while i shall pray
and he taketh with him peter and james and john, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
and saith unto them, my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death
tarry ye here, and watch
and he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him
and he said, abba, father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me
nevertheless not what i will, but what thou wilt
and he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto peter, simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?
watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation
the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak
and again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words
and when he returned, he found them asleep again,  neither wist they what to answer him
and he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, sleep on now, and take your rest
it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand
and immediately, while he yet spake, cometh judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
and he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, whomsoever i shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely
and as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, master, master; and kissed him
and they laid their hands on him, and took him
and one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear
and jesus answered and said unto them, are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?
i was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not
but the scriptures must be fulfilled
and they all forsook him, and fled
and there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him
and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked
and they led jesus away to the high priest
and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes
and peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest
and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire
and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death; and found none
for many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together
and there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
we heard him say, i will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days i will build another made without hands
but neither so did their witness agree together
and the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked jesus, saying, answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
but he held his peace, and answered nothing
again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, art thou the christ, the son of the blessed?
and jesus said, i am
and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, what need we any further witnesses?
ye have heard the blasphemy
what think ye? and they all condemned him to be guilty of death
and some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, prophesy
and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands
and as peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest
and when she saw peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth
but he denied, saying, i know not, neither understand i what thou sayest
and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew
and a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, this is one of them
and he denied it again
and a little after, they that stood by said again to peter, surely thou art one of them
for thou art a galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto
but he began to curse and to swear, saying, i know not this man of whom ye speak
and the second time the cock crew
and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice
and when he thought thereon, he wept
and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to pilate
and pilate asked him, art thou the king of the jews? and he answering said unto him, thou sayest it
and the chief priests accused him of many things
but he answered nothing
and pilate asked him again, saying, answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee
but jesus yet answered nothing; so that pilate marvelled
now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired
and there was one named barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection
and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them
but pilate answered them, saying, will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews?
for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy
but the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release barabbas unto them
and pilate answered and said again unto them, what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews?
and they cried out again, crucify him
then pilate said unto them, why, what evil hath he done? and they cried out the more exceedingly, crucify him
and so pilate, willing to content the people, released barabbas unto them, and delivered jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified
and the soldiers led him away into the hall, called praetorium; and they call together the whole band
and they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
and began to salute him, hail, king of the jews!
and they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him
and when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him
and they compel one simon a cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of alexander and rufus, to bear his cross
and they bring him unto the place golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a skull
and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh
but he received it not
and when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take
and it was the third hour, and they crucified him
and the superscription of his accusation was written over, the king of the jews
and with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left
and the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, and he was numbered with the transgressors
and they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
save thyself, and come down from the cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, he saved others; himself he cannot save
let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe
and they that were crucified with him reviled him
and when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, my god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?
and some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, behold, he calleth elias
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, let alone; let us see whether elias will come to take him down
and jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost
and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom
and when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, truly this man was the son of god
there were also women looking on afar off
among whom was mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james the less and of joses, and salome;
 and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem
and now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
joseph of arimathaea, and honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of god, came, and went in boldly unto pilate, and craved the body of jesus
and pilate marvelled if he were already dead
and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead
and when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to joseph
and he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre
and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid
and when the sabbath was past, mary magdalene, and mary the mother of james, and salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him
and very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun
and they said among themselves, who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
and when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away
for it was very great
and entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted
and he saith unto them, be not affrighted
ye seek jesus of nazareth, which was crucified
he is risen; he is not here
behold the place where they laid him
but go your way, tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee
there shall ye see him, as he said unto you
and they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed
neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid
now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to mary magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils
and she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept
and they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not
after that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country
and they went and told it unto the residue
neither believed they them
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen
and he said unto them, go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned
and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover
so then after the lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of god
and they went forth, and preached everywhere, the lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following
amen
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent theophilus,
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed
there was in the days of herod, the king of judaea, a certain priest named zacharias, of the course of abia
and his wife was of the daughters of aaron, and her name was elisabeth
and they were both righteous before god, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless
and they had no child, because that elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years
and it came to pass, that while he executed the priests office before god in the order of his course,
according to the custom of the priests office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense
and when zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him
but the angel said unto him, fear not, zacharias
for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name john
and thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth
for he shall be great in the sight of the lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the holy ghost, even from his mothers womb
and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god
and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the lord
and zacharias said unto the angel, whereby shall i know this? for i am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years
and the angel answering said unto him, i am gabriel, that stand in the presence of god; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings
and, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season
and the people waited for zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple
and when he came out, he could not speak unto them
and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple
for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless
and it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house
and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men
and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee, named nazareth,
to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph, of the house of david; and the virgins name was mary
and the angel came in unto her, and said, hail, thou that art highly favoured, the lord is with thee
blessed art thou among women
and when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be
and the angel said unto her, fear not, mary
for thou hast found favour with god
and, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name jesus
he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest
and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david
and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end
then said mary unto the angel, how shall this be, seeing i know not a man?
and the angel answered and said unto her, the holy ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee
therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god
and, behold, thy cousin elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age
and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren
for with god nothing shall be impossible
and mary said, behold the handmaid of the lord; be it unto me according to thy word
and the angel departed from her
and mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of juda;
and entered into the house of zacharias, and saluted elisabeth
and it came to pass, that, when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost
and she spake out with a loud voice, and said, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
and whence is this to me, that the mother of my lord should come to me?
for, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy
and blessed is she that believed
for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord
and mary said, my soul doth magnify the lord,
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour
for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden
for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
for he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation
he hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts
he hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree
he hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away
he hath holpen his servant israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
as he spake to our fathers, to abraham, and to his seed for ever
and mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house
now elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son
and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her
and it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him zacharias, after the name of his father
and his mother answered and said, not so; but he shall be called john
and they said unto her, there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name
and they made signs to his father, how he would have him called
and he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, his name is john
and they marvelled all
and his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised god
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them
and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, what manner of child shall this be! and the hand of the lord was with him
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost, and prophesied, saying,
blessed be the lord god of israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david;
as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began
that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;
the oath which he sware to our father abraham,
that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life
and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the highest
for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways;
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,
through the tender mercy of our god; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace
and the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel
and it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from caesar augustus, that all the world should be taxed

and all went to be taxed, every one into his own city
and joseph also went up from galilee, out of the city of nazareth, into judaea, unto the city of david, which is called bethlehem; 
to be taxed with mary his espoused wife, being great with child
and so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered
and she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn
and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night
and, lo, the angel of the lord came upon them, and the glory of the lord shone round about them
and they were sore afraid
and the angel said unto them, fear not
for, behold, i bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people
for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour, which is christ the lord
and this shall be a sign unto you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god, and saying,
glory to god in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men
and it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, let us now go even unto bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the lord hath made known unto us
and they came with haste, and found mary, and joseph, and the babe lying in a manger
and when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child
and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds
but mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart
and the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb
and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished, they brought him to jerusalem, to present him to the lord;

and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons
and, behold, there was a man in jerusalem, whose name was simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of israel
and the holy ghost was upon him
and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the lords christ
and he came by the spirit into the temple
and when the parents brought in the child jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
then took he him up in his arms, and blessed god, and said,
lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
a light to lighten the gentiles, and the glory of thy people israel
and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him
and simeon blessed them, and said unto mary his mother, behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
 that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
and there was one anna, a prophetess, the daughter of phanuel, of the tribe of aser
she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served god with fastings and prayers night and day
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord, they returned into galilee, to their own city nazareth
and the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom
and the grace of god was upon him
now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover
and when he was twelve years old, they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast
and when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem; and joseph and his mother knew not of it
but they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a days journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance
and when they found him not, they turned back again to jerusalem, seeking him
and it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions
and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
and when they saw him, they were amazed
and his mother said unto him, son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing
and he said unto them, how is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business?
and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them
and he went down with them, and came to nazareth, and was subject unto them
but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart
and jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with god and man
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar, pontius pilate being governor of judaea, and herod being tetrarch of galilee, and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis, and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene,
annas and caiaphas being the high priests, the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness
and he came into all the country about jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the lord, make his paths straight
every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god
then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, o generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, we have abraham to our father
for i say unto you, that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees
every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire
and the people asked him, saying, what shall we do then?
he answereth and saith unto them, he that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise
then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, master, what shall we do?
and he said unto them, exact no more than that which is appointed you
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, and what shall we do? and he said unto them, do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages
and as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of john, whether he were the christ, or not;
john answered, saying unto them all, i indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than i cometh, the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose
he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable
and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people
but herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for herodias his brother philips wife, and for all the evils which herod had done,
added yet this above all, that he shut up john in prison
now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, thou art my beloved son; in thee i am well pleased
and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being  the son of joseph, which was the son of heli,
which was the son of matthat, which was the son of levi, which was the son of melchi, which was the son of janna, which was the son of joseph,
which was the son of mattathias, which was the son of amos, which was the son of naum, which was the son of esli, which was the son of nagge,
which was the son of maath, which was the son of mattathias, which was the son of semei, which was the son of joseph, which was the son of juda,
which was the son of joanna, which was the son of rhesa, which was the son of zorobabel, which was the son of salathiel, which was the son of neri,
which was the son of melchi, which was the son of addi, which was the son of cosam, which was the son of elmodam, which was the son of er,
which was the son of jose, which was the son of eliezer, which was the son of jorim, which was the son of matthat, which was the son of levi,
which was the son of simeon, which was the son of juda, which was the son of joseph, which was the son of jonan, which was the son of eliakim,
which was the son of melea, which was the son of menan, which was the son of mattatha, which was the son of nathan, which was the son of david,
which was the son of jesse, which was the son of obed, which was the son of booz, which was the son of salmon, which was the son of naasson,
which was the son of aminadab, which was the son of aram, which was the son of esrom, which was the son of phares, which was the son of juda,
which was the son of jacob, which was the son of isaac, which was the son of abraham, which was the son of thara, which was the son of nachor,
which was the son of saruch, which was the son of ragau, which was the son of phalec, which was the son of heber, which was the son of sala,
which was the son of cainan, which was the son of arphaxad, which was the son of sem, which was the son of noe, which was the son of lamech,
which was the son of mathusala, which was the son of enoch, which was the son of jared, which was the son of maleleel, which was the son of cainan,
which was the son of enos, which was the son of seth, which was the son of adam, which was the son of god
and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan, and was led by the spirit into the wilderness,
being forty days tempted of the devil
and in those days he did eat nothing
and when they were ended, he afterward hungered
and the devil said unto him, if thou be the son of god, command this stone that it be made bread
and jesus answered him, saying, it is written, that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of god
and the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
and the devil said unto him, all this power will i give thee, and the glory of them
for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever i will i give it
if thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine
and jesus answered and said unto him, get thee behind me, satan
for it is written, thou shalt worship the lord thy god, and him only shalt thou serve
and he brought him to jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, if thou be the son of god, cast thyself down from hence
for it is written, he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee
and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
and jesus answering said unto him, it is said, thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
and when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee
and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about
and he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all
and he came to nazareth, where he had been brought up
and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias
and when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
the spirit of the lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
to preach the acceptable year of the lord
and he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down
and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him
and he began to say unto them, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
and all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth
and they said, is not this josephs son?
and he said unto them, ye will surely say unto me this proverb, physician, heal thyself
whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum, do also here in thy country
and he said, verily i say unto you, no prophet is accepted in his own country
but i tell you of a truth, many widows were in israel in the days of elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;
but unto none of them was elias sent, save unto sarepta, a city of sidon, unto a woman that was a widow
and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving naaman the syrian
and all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
and rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong
but he passing through the midst of them went his way,
and came down to capernaum, a city of galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days
and they were astonished at his doctrine
for his word was with power
and in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,
saying, let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou jesus of nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? i know thee who thou art; the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him, saying, hold thy peace, and come out of him
and when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not
and they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, what a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out
and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about
and he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into simons house
and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her
and he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her
and immediately she arose and ministered unto them
now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them
and devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, thou art christ the son of god
and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak
for they knew that he was christ
and when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place
and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them
and he said unto them, i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also
for therefore am i sent
and he preached in the synagogues of galilee
and it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god, he stood by the lake of gennesaret,
and saw two ships standing by the lake
but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets
and he entered into one of the ships, which was simons, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land
and he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship
now when he had left speaking, he said unto simon, launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught
and simon answering said unto him, master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing
nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net
and when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes
and their net brake
and they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them
and they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink
when simon peter saw it, he fell down at jesus knees, saying, depart from me; for i am a sinful man, o lord
for he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken
and so was also james, and john, the sons of zebedee, which were partners with simon
and jesus said unto simon, fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men
and when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him
and it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy
who seeing jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean
and he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, i will
be thou clean
and immediately the leprosy departed from him
and he charged him to tell no man
but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as moses commanded, for a testimony unto them
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him
and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities
and he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed
and it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of galilee, and judaea, and jerusalem
and the power of the lord was present to heal them
and, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy
and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus
and when he saw their faith, he said unto him, man, thy sins are forgiven thee
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason, saying, who is this which speaketh blasphemies? who can forgive sins, but god alone?
but when jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, what reason ye in your hearts?
whether is easier, to say, thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, rise up and walk?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,  i say unto thee, arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house
and immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying god
and they were all amazed, and they glorified god, and were filled with fear, saying, we have seen strange things to day
and after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named levi, sitting at the receipt of custom
and he said unto him, follow me
and he left all, rose up, and followed him
and levi made him a great feast in his own house
and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them
but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
and jesus answering said unto them, they that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick
i came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance
and they said unto him, why do the disciples of john fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
and he said unto them, can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days
and he spake also a parable unto them; no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish
but new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved
no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new
for he saith, the old is better
and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands
and certain of the pharisees said unto them, why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
and jesus answering them said, have ye not read so much as this, what david did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;
how he went into the house of god, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
and he said unto them, that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught
and there was a man whose right hand was withered
and the scribes and pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him
but he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, rise up, and stand forth in the midst
and he arose and stood forth
then said jesus unto them, i will ask you one thing; is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?
and looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, stretch forth thy hand
and he did so
and his hand was restored whole as the other
and they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to jesus
and it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to god
and when it was day, he called unto him his disciples
and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;
simon,  and andrew his brother, james and john, philip and bartholomew,
matthew and thomas, james the son of alphaeus, and simon called zelotes,
and judas the brother of james, and judas iscariot, which also was the traitor
and he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem, and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
and they that were vexed with unclean spirits
and they were healed
and the whole multitude sought to touch him
for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, blessed be ye poor
for yours is the kingdom of god
blessed are ye that hunger now
for ye shall be filled
blessed are ye that weep now
for ye shall laugh
blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the son of mans sake
rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy
for, behold, your reward is great in heaven
for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets
but woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation
woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger
woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep
woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets
but i say unto you which hear, love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,
bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also
give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again
and as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise
for if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them
and if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again
but love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the highest
for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil
be ye therefore merciful, as your father also is merciful
judge not, and ye shall not be judged
condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned
forgive, and ye shall be forgiven
give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom
for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again
and he spake a parable unto them, can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
the disciple is not above his master
but every one that is perfect shall be as his master
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
either how canst thou say to thy brother, brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye
for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
for every tree is known by his own fruit
for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil
for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh
and why call ye me, lord, lord, and do not the things which i say?
whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, i will shew you to whom he is like
he is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock
and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it
for it was founded upon a rock
but he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great
now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into capernaum
and a certain centurions servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die
and when he heard of jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant
and when they came to jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, that he was worthy for whom he should do this
for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue
then jesus went with them
and when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, lord, trouble not thyself
for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof
wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee
but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed
for i also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and i say unto one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doeth it
when jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, i say unto you, i have not found so great faith, no, not in israel
and they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick
and it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow
and much people of the city was with her
and when the lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, weep not
and he came and touched the bier
and they that bare him stood still
and he said, young man, i say unto thee, arise
and he that was dead sat up, and began to speak
and he delivered him to his mother
and there came a fear on all
and they glorified god, saying, that a great prophet is risen up among us; and, that god hath visited his people
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea, and throughout all the region round about
and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus, saying, art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
when the men were come unto him, they said, john baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight
then jesus answering said unto them, go your way, and tell john what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached
and blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me
and when the messengers of john were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning john, what went ye out into the wilderness for to see? a reed shaken with the wind?
but what went ye out for to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts
but what went ye out for to see? a prophet? yea, i say unto you, and much more than a prophet
this is he, of whom it is written, behold, i send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee
for i say unto you, among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist
but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
and all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified god, being baptized with the baptism of john
but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves, being not baptized of him
and the lord said, whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, we have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept
for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, he hath a devil
the son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
but wisdom is justified of all her children
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him
and he went into the pharisees house, and sat down to meat
and, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment
now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, this man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him
for she is a sinner
and jesus answering said unto him, simon, i have somewhat to say unto thee
and he saith, master, say on
there was a certain creditor which had two debtors
the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty
and when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both
tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
simon answered and said, i suppose that he, to whom he forgave most
and he said unto him, thou hast rightly judged
and he turned to the woman, and said unto simon, seest thou this woman? i entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet
but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head
thou gavest me no kiss
but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet
my head with oil thou didst not anoint
but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment
wherefore i say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much
but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little
and he said unto her, thy sins are forgiven
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, who is this that forgiveth sins also?
and he said to the woman, thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace
and it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god
and the twelve were with him,
and certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, mary called magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
and joanna the wife of chuza herods steward, and susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance
and when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable
a sower went out to sow his seed
and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it
and some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture
and some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it
and other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold
and when he had said these things, he cried, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear
and his disciples asked him, saying, what might this parable be?
and he said, unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god
but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand
now the parable is this
the seed is the word of god
those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved
they on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away
and that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection
but that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience
no man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light
for nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad
take heed therefore how ye hear
for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have
then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press
and it was told him by certain which said, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee
and he answered and said unto them, my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god, and do it
now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples
and he said unto them, let us go over unto the other side of the lake
and they launched forth
but as they sailed he fell asleep
and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy
and they came to him, and awoke him, saying, master, master, we perish
then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water
and they ceased, and there was a calm
and he said unto them, where is your faith? and they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, what manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him
and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes, which is over against galilee
and when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs
when he saw jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, what have i to do with thee, jesus, thou son of god most high? i beseech thee, torment me not

and jesus asked him, saying, what is thy name? and he said, legion
because many devils were entered into him
and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain
and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them
and he suffered them
then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine
and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked
when they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country
then they went out to see what was done; and came to jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of jesus, clothed, and in his right mind
and they were afraid
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed
then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear
and he went up into the ship, and returned back again
now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him
but jesus sent him away, saying,
return to thine own house, and shew how great things god hath done unto thee
and he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him
and it came to pass, that, when jesus was returned, the people gladly received him
for they were all waiting for him
and, behold, there came a man named jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue
and he fell down at jesus feet, and besought him that he would come into his house
for he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying
but as he went the people thronged him
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
came behind him, and touched the border of his garment
and immediately her issue of blood stanched
and jesus said, who touched me? when all denied, peter and they that were with him said, master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, who touched me?
and jesus said, somebody hath touched me
for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me
and when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately
and he said unto her, daughter, be of good comfort
thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace
while he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues house, saying to him, thy daughter is dead; trouble not the master
but when jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, fear not
believe only, and she shall be made whole
and when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save peter, and james, and john, and the father and the mother of the maiden
and all wept, and bewailed her
but he said, weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead
and he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, maid, arise
and her spirit came again, and she arose straightway
and he commanded to give her meat
and her parents were astonished
but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done
then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases
and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god, and to heal the sick
and he said unto them, take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece
and whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart
and whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them
and they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where
now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him
and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that john was risen from the dead;
and of some, that elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again
and herod said, john have i beheaded
but who is this, of whom i hear such things? and he desired to see him
and the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done
and he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida
and the people, when they knew it, followed him
and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of god, and healed them that had need of healing
and when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals
for we are here in a desert place
but he said unto them, give ye them to eat
and they said, we have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people
for they were about five thousand men
and he said to his disciples, make them sit down by fifties in a company
and they did so, and made them all sit down
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude
and they did eat, and were all filled
and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
and it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him
and he asked them, saying, whom say the people that i am?
they answering said, john the baptist; but some say, elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again
he said unto them, but whom say ye that i am? peter answering said, the christ of god
and he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;
saying, the son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day
and he said to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it
but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it
for what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his fathers, and of the holy angels
but i tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of god
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took peter and john and james, and went up into a mountain to pray
and as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering
and, behold, there talked with him two men, which were moses and elias
who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem
but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep
and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him
and it came to pass, as they departed from him, peter said unto jesus, master, it is good for us to be here
and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for moses, and one for elias
not knowing what he said
while he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them
and they feared as they entered into the cloud
and there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, this is my beloved son
hear him
and when the voice was past, jesus was found alone
and they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen
and it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him
and, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, master, i beseech thee, look upon my son
for he is mine only child
and, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him
and i besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not
and jesus answering said, o faithless and perverse generation, how long shall i be with you, and suffer you? bring thy son hither
and as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him
and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god
but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
let these sayings sink down into your ears
for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men
but they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not
and they feared to ask him of that saying
then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest
and jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
and said unto them, whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me
and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me
for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great
and john answered and said, master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us
and jesus said unto him, forbid him not
for he that is not against us is for us
and it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem,
and sent messengers before his face
and they went, and entered into a village of the samaritans, to make ready for him
and they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem
and when his disciples james and john saw this, they said, lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as elias did?
but he turned, and rebuked them, and said, ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of
for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them
and they went to another village
and it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, lord, i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus said unto him, foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and he said unto another, follow me
but he said, lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father
jesus said unto him, let the dead bury their dead
but go thou and preach the kingdom of god
and another also said, lord, i will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house
and jesus said unto him, no man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of god
after these things the lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come
therefore said he unto them, the harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few
pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest
go your ways
behold, i send you forth as lambs among wolves
carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes
and salute no man by the way
and into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, peace be to this house
and if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it
if not, it shall turn to you again
and in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give
for the labourer is worthy of his hire
go not from house to house
and into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you
and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
but into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,
even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you
notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
but i say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom, than for that city
woe unto thee, chorazin! woe unto thee, bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment, than for you
and thou, capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell
he that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me
and the seventy returned again with joy, saying, lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name
and he said unto them, i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven
behold, i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy
and nothing shall by any means hurt you
notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven
in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, i thank thee, o father, lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes
even so, father; for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered to me of my father
and no man knoweth who the son is, but the father; and who the father is, but the son, and he to whom the son will reveal him
and he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see
for i tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them
and, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, master, what shall i do to inherit eternal life?
he said unto him, what is written in the law? how readest thou?
and he answering said, thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself
and he said unto him, thou hast answered right
this do, and thou shalt live
but he, willing to justify himself, said unto jesus, and who is my neighbour?
and jesus answering said, a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way
and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side
and likewise a levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side
but a certain samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was
and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,
and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him
and on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when i come again, i will repay thee
which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?
and he said, he that shewed mercy on him
then said jesus unto him, go, and do thou likewise
now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village
and a certain woman named martha received him into her house
and she had a sister called mary, which also sat at jesus feet, and heard his word
but martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me
and jesus answered and said unto her, martha, martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things
but one thing is needful
and mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her
and it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, lord, teach us to pray, as john also taught his disciples
and he said unto them, when ye pray, say, our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth
give us day by day our daily bread
and forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us
and lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil
and he said unto them, which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, friend, lend me three loaves;
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and i have nothing to set before him?
and he from within shall answer and say, trouble me not
the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; i cannot rise and give thee
i say unto you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth
and i say unto you, ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
if ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children
how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him?
and he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb
and it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered
but some of them said, he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils
and others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven
but he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth
if satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges
but if i with the finger of god cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you
when a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace
but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils
he that is not with me is against me
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, i will return unto my house whence i came out
and when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished
then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there
and the last state of that man is worse than the first
and it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked
but he said, yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of god, and keep it
and when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, this is an evil generation
they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of jonas the prophet
for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites, so shall also the son of man be to this generation
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them
for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon; and, behold, a greater than solomon is here
the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it
for they repented at the preaching of jonas; and, behold, a greater than jonas is here
no man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light
the light of the body is the eye
therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness
take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness
if thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light
and as he spake, a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him
and he went in, and sat down to meat
and when the pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner
and the lord said unto him, now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness
ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
but rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you
but woe unto you, pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of god
these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone
woe unto you, pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets
woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them
then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, master, thus saying thou reproachest us also
and he said, woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers
woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers
for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres
therefore also said the wisdom of god, i will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute
that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple
verily i say unto you, it shall be required of this generation
woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge
ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered
and as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things
laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him
in the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees, which is hypocrisy
for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops
and i say unto you my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do
but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear
fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, i say unto you, fear him
are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before god?
but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered
fear not therefore
ye are of more value than many sparrows
also i say unto you, whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god
but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god
and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him
but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven
and when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say
for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say
and one of the company said unto him, master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me
and he said unto him, man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
and he said unto them, take heed, and beware of covetousness
for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth
and he spake a parable unto them, saying, the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully
and he thought within himself, saying, what shall i do, because i have no room where to bestow my fruits?
and he said, this will i do
i will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods
and i will say to my soul, soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry
but god said unto him, thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee
then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?
so is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward god
and he said unto his disciples, therefore i say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on
the life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment
consider the ravens
for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and god feedeth them
how much more are ye better than the fowls?
and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?
consider the lilies how they grow
they toil not, they spin not; and yet i say unto you, that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
if then god so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, o ye of little faith?
and seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after
and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things
but rather seek ye the kingdom of god; and all these things shall be added unto you
fear not, little flock; for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth
for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also
let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately
blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching
verily i say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them
and if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants
and this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through
be ye therefore ready also
for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not
then peter said unto him, lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?
and the lord said, who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?
blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
of a truth i say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath
but and if that servant say in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
and that servant, which knew his lords will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes
but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes
for unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required
and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more
i am come to send fire on the earth; and what will i if it be already kindled?
but i have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am i straitened till it be accomplished!
suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth? i tell you, nay; but rather division
for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three
the father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law
and he said also to the people, when ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, there cometh a shower; and so it is
and when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, there will be heat; and it cometh to pass
ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?
yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison
i tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite
there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans, whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
and jesus answering said unto them, suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans, because they suffered such things?
i tell you, nay
but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish
or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem?
i tell you, nay
but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish
he spake also this parable; a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none
then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, behold, these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none
cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
and he answering said unto him, lord, let it alone this year also, till i shall dig about it, and dung it
and if it bear fruit, well
and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
and, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself
and when jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity
and he laid his hands on her
and immediately she was made straight, and glorified god
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, there are six days in which men ought to work
in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day
the lord then answered him, and said, thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?
and ought not this woman, being a daughter of abraham, whom satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?
and when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed
and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him
then said he, unto what is the kingdom of god like? and whereunto shall i resemble it?
it is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it
and again he said, whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god?
it is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened
and he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward jerusalem
then said one unto him, lord, are there few that be saved? and he said unto them,
strive to enter in at the strait gate
for many, i say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able
when once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, lord, lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, i know you not whence ye are
then shall ye begin to say, we have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets
but he shall say, i tell you, i know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see abraham, and isaac, and jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of god, and you yourselves thrust out
and they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of god
and, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last
the same day there came certain of the pharisees, saying unto him, get thee out, and depart hence
for herod will kill thee
and he said unto them, go ye, and tell that fox, behold, i cast out devils, and i do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day i shall be perfected
nevertheless i must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following
for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem
o jerusalem, jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would i have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!
behold, your house is left unto you desolate
and verily i say unto you, ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him
and, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy
and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees, saying, is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
and they held their peace
and he took him, and healed him, and let him go;
and answered them, saying, which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
and they could not answer him again to these things
and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,
when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;
and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room
but when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, friend, go up higher
then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
then said he also to him that bade him, when thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee
but when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind
and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee
for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god
then said he unto him, a certain man made a great supper, and bade many
and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, come; for all things are now ready
and they all with one consent began to make excuse
the first said unto him, i have bought a piece of ground, and i must needs go and see it
i pray thee have me excused
and another said, i have bought five yoke of oxen, and i go to prove them
i pray thee have me excused
and another said, i have married a wife, and therefore i cannot come
so that servant came, and shewed his lord these things
then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind
and the servant said, lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room
and the lord said unto the servant, go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled
for i say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper
and there went great multitudes with him
and he turned, and said unto them,
if any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple
and whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple
for which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,
saying, this man began to build, and was not able to finish
or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace
so likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple
salt is good
but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
it is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out
he that hath ears to hear, let him hear
then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him
and the pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, this man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them
and he spake this parable unto them, saying,
what man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing
and when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, rejoice with me; for i have found my sheep which was lost
i say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance
either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?
and when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, rejoice with me; for i have found the piece which i had lost
likewise, i say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth
and he said, a certain man had two sons
and the younger of them said to his father, father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me
and he divided unto them his living
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living
and when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want
and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat
and no man gave unto him
and when he came to himself, he said, how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare, and i perish with hunger!
i will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, father, i have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
and am no more worthy to be called thy son
make me as one of thy hired servants
and he arose, and came to his father
but when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him
and the son said unto him, father, i have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son
but the father said to his servants, bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet
and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry
for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found
and they began to be merry
now his elder son was in the field
and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing
and he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant
and he said unto him, thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound
and he was angry, and would not go in
therefore came his father out, and intreated him
and he answering said to his father, lo, these many years do i serve thee, neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment
and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that i might make merry with my friends
but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf
and he said unto him, son, thou art ever with me, and all that i have is thine
it was meet that we should make merry, and be glad
for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found
and he said also unto his disciples, there was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods
and he called him, and said unto him, how is it that i hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward
then the steward said within himself, what shall i do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship
i cannot dig; to beg i am ashamed
i am resolved what to do, that, when i am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses
so he called every one of his lords debtors unto him, and said unto the first, how much owest thou unto my lord?
and he said, an hundred measures of oil
and he said unto him, take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty
then said he to another, and how much owest thou? and he said, an hundred measures of wheat
and he said unto him, take thy bill, and write fourscore
and the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely
for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light
and i say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations
he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much
and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans, who shall give you that which is your own?
no servant can serve two masters
for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other
ye cannot serve god and mammon
and the pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things
and they derided him
and he said unto them, ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but god knoweth your hearts
for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god
the law and the prophets were until john
since that time the kingdom of god is preached, and every man presseth into it
and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail
whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery
and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery
there was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day
and there was a certain beggar named lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table
moreover the dogs came and licked his sores
and it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom
the rich man also died, and was buried;
and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth abraham afar off, and lazarus in his bosom
and he cried and said, father abraham, have mercy on me, and send lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for i am tormented in this flame
but abraham said, son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise lazarus evil things
but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented
and beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed
so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence
then he said, i pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house
for i have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment
abraham saith unto him, they have moses and the prophets; let them hear them
and he said, nay, father abraham
but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent
and he said unto him, if they hear not moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead
then said he unto the disciples, it is impossible but that offences will come
but woe unto him, through whom they come!
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones
take heed to yourselves
if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, i repent; thou shalt forgive him
and the apostles said unto the lord, increase our faith
and the lord said, if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you
but which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, go and sit down to meat?
and will not rather say unto him, make ready wherewith i may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till i have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? i trow not
so likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants
we have done that which was our duty to do
and it came to pass, as he went to jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee
and as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off
and they lifted up their voices, and said, jesus, master, have mercy on us
and when he saw them, he said unto them, go shew yourselves unto the priests
and it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed
and one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified god,
and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks
and he was a samaritan
and jesus answering said, were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
there are not found that returned to give glory to god, save this stranger
and he said unto him, arise, go thy way
thy faith hath made thee whole
and when he was demanded of the pharisees, when the kingdom of god should come, he answered them and said, the kingdom of god cometh not with observation
neither shall they say, lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of god is within you
and he said unto the disciples, the days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man, and ye shall not see it
and they shall say to you, see here; or, see there
go not after them, nor follow them
for as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the son of man be in his day
but first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation
and as it was in the days of noe, so shall it be also in the days of the son of man
they did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all
likewise also as it was in the days of lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all
even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed
in that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away
and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back
remember lots wife
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it
i tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left
two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left
two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left
and they answered and said unto him, where, lord? and he said unto them, wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together
and he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
saying, there was in a city a judge, which feared not god, neither regarded man
and there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, avenge me of mine adversary
and he would not for a while
but afterward he said within himself, though i fear not god, nor regard man;
yet because this widow troubleth me, i will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me
and the lord said, hear what the unjust judge saith
and shall not god avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
i tell you that he will avenge them speedily
nevertheless when the son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others
two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a pharisee, and the other a publican
the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, god, i thank thee, that i am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican
i fast twice in the week, i give tithes of all that i possess
and the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, god be merciful to me a sinner
i tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other
for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
and they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them
but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them
but jesus called them unto him, and said, suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not
for of such is the kingdom of god
verily i say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein
and a certain ruler asked him, saying, good master, what shall i do to inherit eternal life?
and jesus said unto him, why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, god
thou knowest the commandments, do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honour thy father and thy mother
and he said, all these have i kept from my youth up
now when jesus heard these things, he said unto him, yet lackest thou one thing
sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
and come, follow me
and when he heard this, he was very sorrowful
for he was very rich
and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god!
for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they that heard it said, who then can be saved?
and he said, the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
then peter said, lo, we have left all, and followed thee
and he said unto them, verily i say unto you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of gods sake,
who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting
then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, behold, we go up to jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished
for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on
and they shall scourge him, and put him to death
and the third day he shall rise again
and they understood none of these things
and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken
and it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging
and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant
and they told him, that jesus of nazareth passeth by
and he cried, saying, jesus, thou son of david, have mercy on me
and they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace
but he cried so much the more, thou son of david, have mercy on me
and jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him
and when he was come near, he asked him,
saying, what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee? and he said, lord, that i may receive my sight
and jesus said unto him, receive thy sight
thy faith hath saved thee
and immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying god
and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto god
and jesus entered and passed through jericho
and, behold, there was a man named zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich
and he sought to see jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature
and he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him
for he was to pass that way
and when jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day i must abide at thy house
and he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully
and when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner
and zacchaeus stood, and said unto the lord; behold, lord, the half of my goods i give to the poor; and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, i restore him fourfold
and jesus said unto him, this day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
and as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear
he said therefore, a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return
and he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, occupy till i come
but his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, we will not have this man to reign over us
and it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading
then came the first, saying, lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds
and he said unto him, well, thou good servant
because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities
and the second came, saying, lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds
and he said likewise to him, be thou also over five cities
and another came, saying, lord, behold, here is thy pound, which i have kept laid up in a napkin
for i feared thee, because thou art an austere man
thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow
and he saith unto him, out of thine own mouth will i judge thee, thou wicked servant
thou knewest that i was an austere man, taking up that i laid not down, and reaping that i did not sow
wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury?
and he said unto them that stood by, take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds

for i say unto you, that unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him
but those mine enemies, which would not that i should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me
and when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to jerusalem
and it came to pass, when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany, at the mount called the mount of olives, he sent two of his disciples,
saying, go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat
loose him, and bring him hither
and if any man ask you, why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, because the lord hath need of him
and they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them
and as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, why loose ye the colt?
and they said, the lord hath need of him
and they brought him to jesus
and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set jesus thereon
and as he went, they spread their clothes in the way
and when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
saying, blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord
peace in heaven, and glory in the highest
and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, master, rebuke thy disciples
and he answered and said unto them, i tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out
and when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
saying, if thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes
for the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,
and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation
and he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;
saying unto them, it is written, my house is the house of prayer
but ye have made it a den of thieves
and he taught daily in the temple
but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
and could not find what they might do
for all the people were very attentive to hear him
and it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,
and spake unto him, saying, tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
and he answered and said unto them, i will also ask you one thing; and answer me
the baptism of john, was it from heaven, or of men?
and they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall say, from heaven; he will say, why then believed ye him not?
but and if we say, of men; all the people will stone us
for they be persuaded that john was a prophet
and they answered, that they could not tell whence it was
and jesus said unto them, neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
then began he to speak to the people this parable; a certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard
but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty
and again he sent another servant
and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty
and again he sent a third
and they wounded him also, and cast him out
then said the lord of the vineyard, what shall i do? i will send my beloved son
it may be they will reverence him when they see him
but when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, this is the heir
come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours
so they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him
what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
he shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others
and when they heard it, they said, god forbid
and he beheld them, and said, what is this then that is written, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people
for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them
and they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor
and they asked him, saying, master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of god truly
is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar, or no?
but he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, why tempt ye me?
shew me a penny
whose image and superscription hath it? they answered and said, caesars
and he said unto them, render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars, and unto god the things which be gods
and they could not take hold of his words before the people
and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace
then came to him certain of the sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
saying, master, moses wrote unto us, if any mans brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother
there were therefore seven brethren
and the first took a wife, and died without children
and the second took her to wife, and he died childless
and the third took her; and in like manner the seven also
and they left no children, and died
last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them, the children of this world marry, and are given in marriage
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage
neither can they die any more
for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of god, being the children of the resurrection
now that the dead are raised, even moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the lord the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob
for he is not a god of the dead, but of the living
for all live unto him
then certain of the scribes answering said, master, thou hast well said
and after that they durst not ask him any question at all
and he said unto them, how say they that christ is davids son?
and david himself saith in the book of psalms, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand,
till i make thine enemies thy footstool
david therefore calleth him lord, how is he then his son?
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
which devour widows houses, and for a shew make long prayers
the same shall receive greater damnation
and he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites
and he said, of a truth i say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god
but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had
and as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
as for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down
and they asked him, saying, master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?
and he said, take heed that ye be not deceived
for many shall come in my name, saying, i am christ; and the time draweth near
go ye not therefore after them
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified
for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by
then said he unto them, nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven
but before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake
and it shall turn to you for a testimony
settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist
and ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake
but there shall not an hair of your head perish
in your patience possess ye your souls
and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh
then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto
for these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled
but woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people
and they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations
and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles, until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
and there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth
for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
and when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh
and he spake to them a parable; behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand
so likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand
verily i say unto you, this generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away
but my words shall not pass away
and take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares
for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth
watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the son of man
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the passover
and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people
then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot, being of the number of the twelve
and he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them
and they were glad, and covenanted to give him money
and he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude
then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed
and he sent peter and john, saying, go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat
and they said unto him, where wilt thou that we prepare?
and he said unto them, behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in
and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, the master saith unto thee, where is the guestchamber, where i shall eat the passover with my disciples?
and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished
there make ready
and they went, and found as he had said unto them
and they made ready the passover
and when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him
and he said unto them, with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer
for i say unto you, i will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god
and he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, take this, and divide it among yourselves
for i say unto you, i will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of god shall come
and he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, this is my body which is given for you
this do in remembrance of me
likewise also the cup after supper, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you
but, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table
and truly the son of man goeth, as it was determined
but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
and they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing
and there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest
and he said unto them, the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors
but ye shall not be so
but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve
for whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but i am among you as he that serveth
ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations
and i appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father hath appointed unto me;
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
and the lord said, simon, simon, behold, satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat
but i have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not
and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren
and he said unto him, lord, i am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death
and he said, i tell thee, peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me
and he said unto them, when i sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? and they said, nothing
then said he unto them, but now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip
and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one
for i say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, and he was reckoned among the transgressors
for the things concerning me have an end
and they said, lord, behold, here are two swords
and he said unto them, it is enough
and he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of olives; and his disciples also followed him
and when he was at the place, he said unto them, pray that ye enter not into temptation
and he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
saying, father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me
nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done
and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly
and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
and when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
and said unto them, why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation
and while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto jesus to kiss him
but jesus said unto him, judas, betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss?
when they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, lord, shall we smite with the sword?
and one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear
and jesus answered and said, suffer ye thus far
and he touched his ear, and healed him
then jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?
when i was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me
but this is your hour, and the power of darkness
then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priests house
and peter followed afar off
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, peter sat down among them
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, this man was also with him
and he denied him, saying, woman, i know him not
and after a little while another saw him, and said, thou art also of them
and peter said, man, i am not
and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, of a truth this fellow also was with him
for he is a galilaean
and peter said, man, i know not what thou sayest
and immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew
and the lord turned, and looked upon peter
and peter remembered the word of the lord, how he had said unto him, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice
and peter went out, and wept bitterly
and the men that held jesus mocked him, and smote him
and when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
and many other things blasphemously spake they against him
and as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
art thou the christ? tell us
and he said unto them, if i tell you, ye will not believe
and if i also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go
hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god
then said they all, art thou then the son of god? and he said unto them, ye say that i am
and they said, what need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth
and the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto pilate
and they began to accuse him, saying, we found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to caesar, saying that he himself is christ a king
and pilate asked him, saying, art thou the king of the jews? and he answered him and said, thou sayest it
then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people, i find no fault in this man
and they were the more fierce, saying, he stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all jewry, beginning from galilee to this place
when pilate heard of galilee, he asked whether the man were a galilaean
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction, he sent him to herod, who himself also was at jerusalem at that time
and when herod saw jesus, he was exceeding glad
for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing
and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him
and herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to pilate
and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together
for before they were at enmity between themselves
and pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
said unto them, ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people
and, behold, i, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him
no, nor yet herod
for i sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him
i will therefore chastise him, and release him

and they cried out all at once, saying, away with this man, and release unto us barabbas

pilate therefore, willing to release jesus, spake again to them
but they cried, saying, crucify him, crucify him
and he said unto them the third time, why, what evil hath he done? i have found no cause of death in him
i will therefore chastise him, and let him go
and they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified
and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed
and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered jesus to their will
and as they led him away, they laid hold upon one simon, a cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after jesus
and there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him
but jesus turning unto them said, daughters of jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children
for, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck
then shall they begin to say to the mountains, fall on us; and to the hills, cover us
for if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
and there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death
and when they were come to the place, which is called calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left
then said jesus, father, forgive them; for they know not what they do
and they parted his raiment, and cast lots
and the people stood beholding
and the rulers also with them derided him, saying, he saved others; let him save himself, if he be christ, the chosen of god
and the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
and saying, if thou be the king of the jews, save thyself
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek, and latin, and hebrew, this is the king of the jews
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, if thou be christ, save thyself and us
but the other answering rebuked him, saying, dost not thou fear god, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
and we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds
but this man hath done nothing amiss
and he said unto jesus, lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom
and jesus said unto him, verily i say unto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in paradise
and it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour
and the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst
and when jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, father, into thy hands i commend my spirit
and having said thus, he gave up the ghost
now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified god, saying, certainly this was a righteous man
and all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned
and all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things
and, behold, there was a man named joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a just
 he was of arimathaea, a city of the jews
who also himself waited for the kingdom of god
this man went unto pilate, and begged the body of jesus
and he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid
and that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on
and the women also, which came with him from galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid
and they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment
now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them
and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
and they entered in, and found not the body of the lord jesus
and it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments
and as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, why seek ye the living among the dead?
he is not here, but is risen
remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee,
saying, the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again
and they remembered his words,
and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest
it was mary magdalene, and joanna, and mary the mother of james, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles
and their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not
then arose peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass
and, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus, which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs
and they talked together of all these things which had happened
and it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, jesus himself drew near, and went with them
but their eyes were holden that they should not know him
and he said unto them, what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
and the one of them, whose name was cleopas, answering said unto him, art thou only a stranger in jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?
and he said unto them, what things? and they said unto him, concerning jesus of nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him
but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel
and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done
yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said
but him they saw not
then he said unto them, o fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
ought not christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
and beginning at moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
and they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went
and he made as though he would have gone further
but they constrained him, saying, abide with us
for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent
and he went in to tarry with them
and it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them
and their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight
and they said one to another, did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
and they rose up the same hour, and returned to jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
saying, the lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to simon
and they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread
and as they thus spake, jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, peace be unto you
but they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit
and he said unto them, why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
behold my hands and my feet, that it is i myself
handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have
and when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet
and while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, have ye here any meat?
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb
and he took it, and did eat before them
and he said unto them, these are the words which i spake unto you, while i was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me
then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
and said unto them, thus it is written, and thus it behoved christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at jerusalem
and ye are witnesses of these things
and, behold, i send the promise of my father upon you
but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high
and he led them out as far as to bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them
and it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven
and they worshipped him, and returned to jerusalem with great joy
and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing god
amen
in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god
the same was in the beginning with god
all things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made
in him was life; and the life was the light of men
and the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not
there was a man sent from god, whose name was john
the same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe
he was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light
that was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not
he came unto his own, and his own received him not
but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of god, even to them that believe on his name
which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of god
and the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,  full of grace and truth
john bare witness of him, and cried, saying, this was he of whom i spake, he that cometh after me is preferred before me
for he was before me
and of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace
for the law was given by moses, but grace and truth came by jesus christ
no man hath seen god at any time; the only begotten son, which is in the bosom of the father, he hath declared him
and this is the record of john, when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him, who art thou?
and he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, i am not the christ
and they asked him, what then? art thou elias? and he saith, i am not
art thou that prophet? and he answered, no
then said they unto him, who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us
what sayest thou of thyself?
he said, i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the lord, as said the prophet esaias
and they which were sent were of the pharisees
and they asked him, and said unto him, why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that christ, nor elias, neither that prophet?
john answered them, saying, i baptize with water
but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose
these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan, where john was baptizing
the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him, and saith, behold the lamb of god, which taketh away the sin of the world
this is he of whom i said, after me cometh a man which is preferred before me
for he was before me
and i knew him not
but that he should be made manifest to israel, therefore am i come baptizing with water
and john bare record, saying, i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him
and i knew him not
but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost
and i saw, and bare record that this is the son of god
again the next day after john stood, and two of his disciples;
and looking upon jesus as he walked, he saith, behold the lamb of god!
and the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed jesus
then jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, what seek ye? they said unto him, rabbi,  where dwellest thou?
he saith unto them, come and see
they came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day
for it was about the tenth hour
one of the two which heard john speak, and followed him, was andrew, simon peters brother
he first findeth his own brother simon, and saith unto him, we have found the messias, which is, being interpreted, the christ
and he brought him to jesus
and when jesus beheld him, he said, thou art simon the son of jona
thou shalt be called cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone
the day following jesus would go forth into galilee, and findeth philip, and saith unto him, follow me
now philip was of bethsaida, the city of andrew and peter
philip findeth nathanael, and saith unto him, we have found him, of whom moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, jesus of nazareth, the son of joseph
and nathanael said unto him, can there any good thing come out of nazareth? philip saith unto him, come and see
jesus saw nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, behold an israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
nathanael saith unto him, whence knowest thou me? jesus answered and said unto him, before that philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, i saw thee
nathanael answered and saith unto him, rabbi, thou art the son of god; thou art the king of israel
jesus answered and said unto him, because i said unto thee, i saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these
and he saith unto him, verily, verily, i say unto you, hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee; and the mother of jesus was there
and both jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage
and when they wanted wine, the mother of jesus saith unto him, they have no wine
jesus saith unto her, woman, what have i to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come
his mother saith unto the servants, whatsoever he saith unto you, do it
and there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the jews, containing two or three firkins apiece
jesus saith unto them, fill the waterpots with water
and they filled them up to the brim
and he saith unto them, draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast
and they bare it
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was
the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
and saith unto him, every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse
but thou hast kept the good wine until now
this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him
after this he went down to capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples
and they continued there not many days
and the jews passover was at hand, and jesus went up to jerusalem,
and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting
and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers money, and overthrew the tables;
and said unto them that sold doves, take these things hence; make not my fathers house an house of merchandise
and his disciples remembered that it was written, the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
then answered the jews and said unto him, what sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
jesus answered and said unto them, destroy this temple, and in three days i will raise it up
then said the jews, forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
but he spake of the temple of his body
when therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which jesus had said
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did
but jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
and needed not that any should testify of man
for he knew what was in man
there was a man of the pharisees, named nicodemus, a ruler of the jews
the same came to jesus by night, and said unto him, rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from god
for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except god be with him
jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily, i say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of god
nicodemus saith unto him, how can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mothers womb, and be born?
jesus answered, verily, verily, i say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
marvel not that i said unto thee, ye must be born again
the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth
so is every one that is born of the spirit
nicodemus answered and said unto him, how can these things be?
jesus answered and said unto him, art thou a master of israel, and knowest not these things?
verily, verily, i say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness
if i have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if i tell you of heavenly things?
and no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life
for god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life
for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved
he that believeth on him is not condemned
but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god
and this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in god
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized
and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim, because there was much water there
and they came, and were baptized
for john was not yet cast into prison
then there arose a question between some of johns disciples and the jews about purifying
and they came unto john, and said unto him, rabbi, he that was with thee beyond jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him
john answered and said, a man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven
ye yourselves bear me witness, that i said, i am not the christ, but that i am sent before him
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom
but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice
this my joy therefore is fulfilled
he must increase, but i must decrease
he that cometh from above is above all
he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth
he that cometh from heaven is above all
and what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony
he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god
for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him
the father loveth the son, and hath given all things into his hand
he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life
and he that believeth not the son shall not see life; but the wrath of god abideth on him
when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john,

he left judaea, and departed again into galilee
and he must needs go through samaria
then cometh he to a city of samaria, which is called sychar, near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph
now jacobs well was there
jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well
and it was about the sixth hour
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water
jesus saith unto her, give me to drink

then saith the woman of samaria unto him, how is it that thou, being a jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of samaria? for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans
jesus answered and said unto her, if thou knewest the gift of god, and who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water
the woman saith unto him, sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep
from whence then hast thou that living water?
art thou greater than our father jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
jesus answered and said unto her, whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again
but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life
the woman saith unto him, sir, give me this water, that i thirst not, neither come hither to draw
jesus saith unto her, go, call thy husband, and come hither
the woman answered and said, i have no husband
jesus said unto her, thou hast well said, i have no husband
for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband
in that saidst thou truly
the woman saith unto him, sir, i perceive that thou art a prophet
our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship
jesus saith unto her, woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at jerusalem, worship the father
ye worship ye know not what
we know what we worship
for salvation is of the jews
but the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth
for the father seeketh such to worship him
god is a spirit
and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
the woman saith unto him, i know that messias cometh, which is called christ
when he is come, he will tell us all things
jesus saith unto her, i that speak unto thee am he
and upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman
yet no man said, what seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?
the woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
come, see a man, which told me all things that ever i did
is not this the christ?
then they went out of the city, and came unto him
in the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, master, eat
but he said unto them, i have meat to eat that ye know not of
therefore said the disciples one to another, hath any man brought him ought to eat?
jesus saith unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work
say not ye, there are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, i say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest
and he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal
that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together
and herein is that saying true, one soweth, and another reapeth
i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour
other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours
and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, he told me all that ever i did
so when the samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them
and he abode there two days
and many more believed because of his own word;
and said unto the woman, now we believe, not because of thy saying
for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the christ, the saviour of the world
now after two days he departed thence, and went into galilee
for jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country
then when he was come into galilee, the galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast
for they also went unto the feast
so jesus came again into cana of galilee, where he made the water wine
and there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at capernaum
when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son
for he was at the point of death
then said jesus unto him, except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe
the nobleman saith unto him, sir, come down ere my child die
jesus saith unto him, go thy way; thy son liveth
and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way
and as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, thy son liveth
then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend
and they said unto him, yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him
so the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which jesus said unto him, thy son liveth
and himself believed, and his whole house
this is again the second miracle that jesus did, when he was come out of judaea into galilee
after this there was a feast of the jews; and jesus went up to jerusalem
now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda, having five porches
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water
whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had
and a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years
when jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, wilt thou be made whole?
the impotent man answered him, sir, i have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool
but while i am coming, another steppeth down before me
jesus saith unto him, rise, take up thy bed, and walk
and immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked
and on the same day was the sabbath
the jews therefore said unto him that was cured, it is the sabbath day
it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed
he answered them, he that made me whole, the same said unto me, take up thy bed, and walk
then asked they him, what man is that which said unto thee, take up thy bed, and walk?
and he that was healed wist not who it was
for jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place
afterward jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, behold, thou art made whole
sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee
the man departed, and told the jews that it was jesus, which had made him whole
and therefore did the jews persecute jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day
but jesus answered them, my father worketh hitherto, and i work
therefore the jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that god was his father, making himself equal with god
then answered jesus and said unto them, verily, verily, i say unto you, the son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the father do
for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the son likewise
for the father loveth the son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth
and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel
for as the father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the son quickeneth whom he will
for the father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the son
that all men should honour the son, even as they honour the father
he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life
verily, verily, i say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god
and they that hear shall live
for as the father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the son to have life in himself;
and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the son of man
marvel not at this
for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation
i can of mine own self do nothing
as i hear, i judge
and my judgment is just; because i seek not mine own will, but the will of the father which hath sent me
if i bear witness of myself, my witness is not true
there is another that beareth witness of me; and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true
ye sent unto john, and he bare witness unto the truth
but i receive not testimony from man
but these things i say, that ye might be saved
he was a burning and a shining light
and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light
but i have greater witness than that of john
for the works which the father hath given me to finish, the same works that i do, bear witness of me, that the father hath sent me
and the father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me
ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape
and ye have not his word abiding in you
for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not
search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life
and they are they which testify of me
and ye will not come to me, that ye might have life
i receive not honour from men
but i know you, that ye have not the love of god in you
i am come in my fathers name, and ye receive me not
if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive
how can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from god only?
do not think that i will accuse you to the father
there is one that accuseth you, even moses, in whom ye trust
for had ye believed moses, ye would have believed me
for he wrote of me
but if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee, which is the sea of tiberias
and a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased
and jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples
and the passover, a feast of the jews, was nigh
when jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto philip, whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
and this he said to prove him
for he himself knew what he would do
philip answered him, two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little
one of his disciples, andrew, simon peters brother, saith unto him,
there is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes
but what are they among so many?
and jesus said, make the men sit down
now there was much grass in the place
so the men sat down, in number about five thousand
and jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would
when they were filled, he said unto his disciples, gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost
therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten
then those men, when they had seen the miracle that jesus did, said, this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world
when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone
and when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward capernaum
and it was now dark, and jesus was not come to them
and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship
and they were afraid
but he saith unto them, it is i; be not afraid
then they willingly received him into the ship
and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went
the day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;

when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to capernaum, seeking for jesus
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, rabbi, when camest thou hither?
jesus answered them and said, verily, verily, i say unto you, ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled
labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the son of man shall give unto you
for him hath god the father sealed
then said they unto him, what shall we do, that we might work the works of god?
jesus answered and said unto them, this is the work of god, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
they said therefore unto him, what sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to eat
then jesus said unto them, verily, verily, i say unto you, moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven
for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world
then said they unto him, lord, evermore give us this bread
and jesus said unto them, i am the bread of life
he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
but i said unto you, that ye also have seen me, and believe not
all that the father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
for i came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me
and this is the fathers will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day
and this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life
and i will raise him up at the last day
the jews then murmured at him, because he said, i am the bread which came down from heaven
and they said, is not this jesus, the son of joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, i came down from heaven?
jesus therefore answered and said unto them, murmur not among yourselves
no man can come to me, except the father which hath sent me draw him
and i will raise him up at the last day
it is written in the prophets, and they shall be all taught of god
every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the father, cometh unto me
not that any man hath seen the father, save he which is of god, he hath seen the father
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life
i am that bread of life
your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die
i am the living bread which came down from heaven
if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever
and the bread that i will give is my flesh, which i will give for the life of the world
the jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, how can this man give us his flesh to eat?
then jesus said unto them, verily, verily, i say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you
whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and i will raise him up at the last day
for my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed
he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and i in him
as the living father hath sent me, and i live by the father
so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me
this is that bread which came down from heaven
not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead
he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever
these things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in capernaum
many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, this is an hard saying; who can hear it?
when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, doth this offend you?
what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before?
it is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing
the words that i speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life
but there are some of you that believe not
for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him
and he said, therefore said i unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my father
from that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him
then said jesus unto the twelve, will ye also go away?
then simon peter answered him, lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life
and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ, the son of the living god
jesus answered them, have not i chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon
for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve
after these things jesus walked in galilee
for he would not walk in jewry, because the jews sought to kill him
now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand
his brethren therefore said unto him, depart hence, and go into judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly
if thou do these things, shew thyself to the world
for neither did his brethren believe in him
then jesus said unto them, my time is not yet come
but your time is alway ready
the world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because i testify of it, that the works thereof are evil
go ye up unto this feast
i go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come
when he had said these words unto them, he abode still in galilee
but when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret
then the jews sought him at the feast, and said, where is he?
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him
for some said, he is a good man
others said, nay; but he deceiveth the people
howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews
now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple, and taught
and the jews marvelled, saying, how knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
jesus answered them, and said, my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me
if any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of god, or whether i speak of myself
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory
but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him
did not moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? why go ye about to kill me?
the people answered and said, thou hast a devil
who goeth about to kill thee?
jesus answered and said unto them, i have done one work, and ye all marvel
moses therefore gave unto you circumcision;  and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment
then said some of them of jerusalem, is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
but, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him
do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ?
howbeit we know this man whence he is
but when christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is
then cried jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, ye both know me, and ye know whence i am
and i am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not
but i know him
for i am from him, and he hath sent me
then they sought to take him
but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come
and many of the people believed on him, and said, when christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him
then said jesus unto them, yet a little while am i with you, and then i go unto him that sent me
ye shall seek me, and shall not find me
and where i am, thither ye cannot come
then said the jews among themselves, whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles, and teach the gentiles?
what manner of saying is this that he said, ye shall seek me, and shall not find me
and where i am, thither ye cannot come?
in the last day, that great day of the feast, jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink
he that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water

many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, of a truth this is the prophet
others said, this is the christ
but some said, shall christ come out of galilee?
hath not the scripture said, that christ cometh of the seed of david, and out of the town of bethlehem, where david was?
so there was a division among the people because of him
and some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him
then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees; and they said unto them, why have ye not brought him?
the officers answered, never man spake like this man
then answered them the pharisees, are ye also deceived?
have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him?
but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed
nicodemus saith unto them, 
doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
they answered and said unto him, art thou also of galilee? search, and look
for out of galilee ariseth no prophet
and every man went unto his own house
jesus went unto the mount of olives
and early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them
and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
they say unto him, master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act
now moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned
but what sayest thou?
this they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him
but jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not
so when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her
and again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground
and they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last
and jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst
when jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
she said, no man, lord
and jesus said unto her, neither do i condemn thee
go, and sin no more
then spake jesus again unto them, saying, i am the light of the world
he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life
the pharisees therefore said unto him, thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true
jesus answered and said unto them, though i bear record of myself, yet my record is true
for i know whence i came, and whither i go; but ye cannot tell whence i come, and whither i go
ye judge after the flesh; i judge no man
and yet if i judge, my judgment is true
for i am not alone, but i and the father that sent me
it is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true
i am one that bear witness of myself, and the father that sent me beareth witness of me
then said they unto him, where is thy father? jesus answered, ye neither know me, nor my father
if ye had known me, ye should have known my father also
these words spake jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple
and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come
then said jesus again unto them, i go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins
whither i go, ye cannot come
then said the jews, will he kill himself? because he saith, whither i go, ye cannot come
and he said unto them, ye are from beneath; i am from above
ye are of this world; i am not of this world
i said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins
for if ye believe not that i am he, ye shall die in your sins
then said they unto him, who art thou? and jesus saith unto them, even the same that i said unto you from the beginning
i have many things to say and to judge of you
but he that sent me is true; and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him
they understood not that he spake to them of the father
then said jesus unto them, when ye have lifted up the son of man, then shall ye know that i am he, and that i do nothing of myself; but as my father hath taught me, i speak these things
and he that sent me is with me
the father hath not left me alone; for i do always those things that please him
as he spake these words, many believed on him
then said jesus to those jews which believed on him, if ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;
and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free
they answered him, we be abrahams seed, and were never in bondage to any man
how sayest thou, ye shall be made free?
jesus answered them, verily, verily, i say unto you, whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
and the servant abideth not in the house for ever
but the son abideth ever
if the son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed
i know that ye are abrahams seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you
i speak that which i have seen with my father
and ye do that which ye have seen with your father
they answered and said unto him, abraham is our father
jesus saith unto them, if ye were abrahams children, ye would do the works of abraham
but now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which i have heard of god
this did not abraham
ye do the deeds of your father
then said they to him, we be not born of fornication; we have one father, even god
jesus said unto them, if god were your father, ye would love me
for i proceeded forth and came from god; neither came i of myself, but he sent me
why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word
ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do
he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him
when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own
for he is a liar, and the father of it
and because i tell you the truth, ye believe me not
which of you convinceth me of sin? and if i say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
he that is of god heareth gods words
ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of god
then answered the jews, and said unto him, say we not well that thou art a samaritan, and hast a devil?
jesus answered, i have not a devil; but i honour my father, and ye do dishonour me
and i seek not mine own glory
there is one that seeketh and judgeth
verily, verily, i say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death
then said the jews unto him, now we know that thou hast a devil
abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, if a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death
art thou greater than our father abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead
whom makest thou thyself?
jesus answered, if i honour myself, my honour is nothing
it is my father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your god
yet ye have not known him; but i know him
and if i should say, i know him not, i shall be a liar like unto you
but i know him, and keep his saying
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day
and he saw it, and was glad
then said the jews unto him, thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen abraham?
jesus said unto them, verily,verily, i say unto you, before abraham was, i am
then took they up stones to cast at him
but jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by
and as jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth
and his disciples asked him, saying, master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
jesus answered, neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents
but that the works of god should be made manifest in him
i must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day
the night cometh, when no man can work
as long as i am in the world, i am the light of the world
when he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
and said unto him, go, wash in the pool of siloam,  he went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing
the neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, is not this he that sat and begged?
some said, this is he
others said, he is like him
but he said, i am he
therefore said they unto him, how were thine eyes opened?
he answered and said, a man that is called jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, go to the pool of siloam, and wash
and i went and washed, and i received sight
then said they unto him, where is he? he said, i know not
they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind
and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes
then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight
he said unto them, he put clay upon mine eyes, and i washed, and do see
therefore said some of the pharisees, this man is not of god, because he keepeth not the sabbath day
others said, how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? and there was a division among them
they say unto the blind man again, what sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? he said, he is a prophet
but the jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight
and they asked them, saying, is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
his parents answered them and said, we know that this is our son, and that he was born blind
but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not
he is of age; ask him
he shall speak for himself
these words spake his parents, because they feared the jews
for the jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was christ, he should be put out of the synagogue
therefore said his parents, he is of age; ask him
then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, give god the praise
we know that this man is a sinner
he answered and said, whether he be a sinner or no, i know not
one thing i know, that, whereas i was blind, now i see
then said they to him again, what did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
he answered them, i have told you already, and ye did not hear
wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
then they reviled him, and said, thou art his disciple; but we are moses disciples
we know that god spake unto moses
as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is
the man answered and said unto them, why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes
now we know that god heareth not sinners
but if any man be a worshipper of god, and doeth his will, him he heareth
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind
if this man were not of god, he could do nothing
they answered and said unto him, thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? and they cast him out
jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, dost thou believe on the son of god?
he answered and said, who is he, lord, that i might believe on him?
and jesus said unto him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee
and he said, lord, i believe
and he worshipped him
and jesus said, for judgment i am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind
and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, are we blind also?
jesus said unto them, if ye were blind, ye should have no sin
but now ye say, we see; therefore your sin remaineth
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
to him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice
and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out
and when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him
for they know his voice
and a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him
for they know not the voice of strangers
this parable spake jesus unto them
but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them
then said jesus unto them again, verily, verily, i say unto you, i am the door of the sheep
all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers
but the sheep did not hear them
i am the door
by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture
the thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy
i am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly
i am the good shepherd
the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep
but he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth
and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep
the hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep
i am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine
as the father knoweth me, even so know i the father
and i lay down my life for the sheep
and other sheep i have, which are not of this fold
them also i must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd
therefore doth my father love me, because i lay down my life, that i might take it again
no man taketh it from me, but i lay it down of myself
i have power to lay it down, and i have power to take it again
this commandment have i received of my father
there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings
and many of them said, he hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
others said, these are not the words of him that hath a devil
can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter
and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch
then came the jews round about him, and said unto him, how long dost thou make us to doubt? if thou be the christ, tell us plainly
jesus answered them, i told you, and ye believed not
the works that i do in my fathers name, they bear witness of me
but ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as i said unto you
my sheep hear my voice, and i know them, and they follow me
and i give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
my father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand
i and my father are one
then the jews took up stones again to stone him
jesus answered them, many good works have i shewed you from my father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
the jews answered him, saying, for a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself god
jesus answered them, is it not written in your law, i said, ye are gods?
if he called them gods, unto whom the word of god came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
say ye of him, whom the father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, thou blasphemest; because i said, i am the son of god?
if i do not the works of my father, believe me not
but if i do, though ye believe not me, believe the works
that ye may know, and believe, that the father is in me, and i in him
therefore they sought again to take him
but he escaped out of their hand,
and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized; and there he abode
and many resorted unto him, and said, john did no miracle
but all things that john spake of this man were true
and many believed on him there
now a certain man was sick, named lazarus, of bethany, the town of mary and her sister martha

therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick
when jesus heard that, he said, this sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of god, that the son of god might be glorified thereby
now jesus loved martha, and her sister, and lazarus
when he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was
then after that saith he to his disciples, let us go into judaea again
his disciples say unto him, master, the jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
jesus answered, are there not twelve hours in the day? if any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world
but if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him
these things said he
and after that he saith unto them, our friend lazarus sleepeth; but i go, that i may awake him out of sleep
then said his disciples, lord, if he sleep, he shall do well
howbeit jesus spake of his death
but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep
then said jesus unto them plainly, lazarus is dead
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him
then said thomas, which is called didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, let us also go, that we may die with him
then when jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already
now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off
and many of the jews came to martha and mary, to comfort them concerning their brother
then martha, as soon as she heard that jesus was coming, went and met him
but mary sat still in the house
then said martha unto jesus, lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died
but i know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of god, god will give it thee
jesus saith unto her, thy brother shall rise again
martha saith unto him, i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day
jesus said unto her, i am the resurrection, and the life
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
believest thou this?
she saith unto him, yea, lord
i believe that thou art the christ, the son of god, which should come into the world
and when she had so said, she went her way, and called mary her sister secretly, saying, the master is come, and calleth for thee
as soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him
now jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where martha met him
the jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, she goeth unto the grave to weep there
then when mary was come where jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died
when jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
and said, where have ye laid him? they said unto him, lord, come and see
jesus wept
then said the jews, behold how he loved him!
and some of them said, could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave
it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it
jesus said, take ye away the stone
martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, lord, by this time he stinketh
for he hath been dead four days
jesus saith unto her, said i not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of god?
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid
and jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, father, i thank thee that thou hast heard me
and i knew that thou hearest me always
but because of the people which stand by i said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me
and when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, lazarus, come forth
and he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes
and his face was bound about with a napkin
jesus saith unto them, loose him, and let him go
then many of the jews which came to mary, and had seen the things which jesus did, believed on him
but some of them went their ways to the pharisees, and told them what things jesus had done
then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council, and said, what do we? for this man doeth many miracles
if we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him
and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation
and one of them, named caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, ye know nothing at all,
nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not
and this spake he not of himself
but being high priest that year, he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation;
and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad
then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death
jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called ephraim, and there continued with his disciples
and the jews passover was nigh at hand
and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves
then sought they for jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, what think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him
then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany, where lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead
there they made him a supper; and martha served
but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him
then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair
and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment
then saith one of his disciples, judas iscariot, simons son, which should betray him,
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
this he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein
then said jesus, let her alone
against the day of my burying hath she kept this
for the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always
much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there
and they came not for jesus sake only, but that they might see lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead
but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death;
because that by reason of him many of the jews went away, and believed on jesus
on the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem,
took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, hosanna
blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
fear not, daughter of sion
behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an asss colt
these things understood not his disciples at the first
but when jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him
the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record
for this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle
the pharisees therefore said among themselves, perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him
and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast
the same came therefore to philip, which was of bethsaida of galilee, and desired him, saying, sir, we would see jesus
philip cometh and telleth andrew
and again andrew and philip tell jesus
and jesus answered them, saying, the hour is come, that the son of man should be glorified
verily, verily, i say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone
but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit
he that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal
if any man serve me, let him follow me; and where i am, there shall also my servant be
if any man serve me, him will my father honour
now is my soul troubled; and what shall i say? father, save me from this hour
but for this cause came i unto this hour
father, glorify thy name
then came there a voice from heaven, saying, i have both glorified it, and will glorify it again
the people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered
others said, an angel spake to him
jesus answered and said, this voice came not because of me, but for your sakes
now is the judgment of this world
now shall the prince of this world be cast out
and i, if i be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me
this he said, signifying what death he should die
the people answered him, we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever
and how sayest thou, the son of man must be lifted up? who is this son of man?
then jesus said unto them, yet a little while is the light with you
walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you
for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth
while ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light
these things spake jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them
but though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him
that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed?
therefore they could not believe, because that esaias said again,
he hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and i should heal them
these things said esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god
jesus cried and said, he that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me
and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
i am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
and if any man hear my words, and believe not, i judge him not
for i came not to judge the world, but to save the world
he that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him
the word that i have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day
for i have not spoken of myself; but the father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what i should say, and what i should speak
and i know that his commandment is life everlasting
whatsoever i speak therefore, even as the father said unto me, so i speak
now before the feast of the passover, when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end
and supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot, simons son, to betray him;
jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from god, and went to god;
he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself
after that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded
then cometh he to simon peter
and peter saith unto him, lord, dost thou wash my feet?
jesus answered and said unto him, what i do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter
peter saith unto him, thou shalt never wash my feet
jesus answered him, if i wash thee not, thou hast no part with me
simon peter saith unto him, lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head
jesus saith to him, he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit
and ye are clean, but not all
for he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, ye are not all clean
so after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, know ye what i have done to you?
ye call me master and lord
and ye say well; for so i am
if i then, your lord and master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one anothers feet
for i have given you an example, that ye should do as i have done to you
verily, verily, i say unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him
if ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them
i speak not of you all
i know whom i have chosen
but that the scripture may be fulfilled, he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me
now i tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that i am he
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
when jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, verily, verily, i say unto you, that one of you shall betray me
then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake
now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples, whom jesus loved
simon peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake
he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him, lord, who is it?
jesus answered, he it is, to whom i shall give a sop, when i have dipped it
and when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to judas iscariot, the son of simon
and after the sop satan entered into him
then said jesus unto him, that thou doest, do quickly
now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him
for some of them thought, because judas had the bag, that jesus had said unto him, buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor
he then having received the sop went immediately out
and it was night
therefore, when he was gone out, jesus said, now is the son of man glorified, and god is glorified in him
if god be glorified in him, god shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him
little children, yet a little while i am with you
ye shall seek me
and as i said unto the jews, whither i go, ye cannot come; so now i say to you
a new commandment i give unto you, that ye love one another; as i have loved you, that ye also love one another
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another
simon peter said unto him, lord, whither goest thou? jesus answered him, whither i go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards
peter said unto him, lord, why cannot i follow thee now? i will lay down my life for thy sake
jesus answered him, wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? verily, verily, i say unto thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice
let not your heart be troubled
ye believe in god, believe also in me
in my fathers house are many mansions
if it were not so, i would have told you
i go to prepare a place for you
and if i go and prepare a place for you, i will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where i am, there ye may be also
and whither i go ye know, and the way ye know
thomas saith unto him, lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?
jesus saith unto him, i am the way, the truth, and the life
no man cometh unto the father, but by me
if ye had known me, ye should have known my father also
and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him
philip saith unto him, lord, shew us the father, and it sufficeth us
jesus saith unto him, have i been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the father; and how sayest thou then, shew us the father?
believest thou not that i am in the father, and the father in me? the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself
but the father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works
believe me that i am in the father, and the father in me
or else believe me for the very works sake
verily, verily, i say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that i do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because i go unto my father
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will i do, that the father may be glorified in the son
if ye shall ask any thing in my name, i will do it
if ye love me, keep my commandments
and i will pray the father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
even the spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him
but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you
i will not leave you comfortless
i will come to you
yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me
because i live, ye shall live also
at that day ye shall know that i am in my father, and ye in me, and i in you
he that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me
and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and i will love him, and will manifest myself to him
judas saith unto him, not iscariot, lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
jesus answered and said unto him, if a man love me, he will keep my words
and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him
he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings
and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the fathers which sent me
these things have i spoken unto you, being yet present with you
but the comforter, which is the holy ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever i have said unto you
peace i leave with you, my peace i give unto you
not as the world giveth, give i unto you
let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid
ye have heard how i said unto you, i go away, and come again unto you
if ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because i said, i go unto the father
for my father is greater than i
and now i have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe
hereafter i will not talk much with you
for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me
but that the world may know that i love the father; and as the father gave me commandment, even so i do
arise, let us go hence
i am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away
and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit
now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you
abide in me, and i in you
as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me
i am the vine, ye are the branches
he that abideth in me, and i in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit
for without me ye can do nothing
if a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned
if ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you
herein is my father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples
as the father hath loved me, so have i loved you
continue ye in my love
if ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as i have kept my fathers commandments, and abide in his love
these things have i spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full
this is my commandment, that ye love one another, as i have loved you
greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends
ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever i command you
henceforth i call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth
but i have called you friends; for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you
ye have not chosen me, but i have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain
that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name, he may give it you
these things i command you, that ye love one another
if the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you
if ye were of the world, the world would love his own
but because ye are not of the world, but i have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you
remember the word that i said unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord
if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also
but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake, because they know not him that sent me
if i had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin
but now they have no cloke for their sin
he that hateth me hateth my father also
if i had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin
but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father
but this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, they hated me without a cause
but when the comforter is come, whom i will send unto you from the father, even the spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the father, he shall testify of me
and ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning
these things have i spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended
they shall put you out of the synagogues
yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service
and these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the father, nor me
but these things have i told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that i told you of them
and these things i said not unto you at the beginning, because i was with you
but now i go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, whither goest thou?
but because i have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart
nevertheless i tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that i go away
for if i go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if i depart, i will send him unto you
and when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment
of sin, because they believe not on me;
of righteousness, because i go to my father, and ye see me no more;
of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged
i have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now
howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth
for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak
and he will shew you things to come
he shall glorify me
for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you
all things that the father hath are mine
therefore said i, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you
a little while, and ye shall not see me
and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because i go to the father
then said some of his disciples among themselves, what is this that he saith unto us, a little while, and ye shall not see me
and again, a little while, and ye shall see me
and, because i go to the father?
they said therefore, what is this that he saith, a little while? we cannot tell what he saith
now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, do ye inquire among yourselves of that i said, a little while, and ye shall not see me
and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
verily, verily, i say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice
and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come
but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world
and ye now therefore have sorrow
but i will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing
verily, verily, i say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name, he will give it you
hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name
ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full
these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs
but the time cometh, when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but i shall shew you plainly of the father
at that day ye shall ask in my name
and i say not unto you, that i will pray the father for you
for the father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that i came out from god
i came forth from the father, and am come into the world
again, i leave the world, and go to the father
his disciples said unto him, lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb
now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee
by this we believe that thou camest forth from god
jesus answered them, do ye now believe?
behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone
and yet i am not alone, because the father is with me
these things i have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace
in the world ye shall have tribulation
but be of good cheer; i have overcome the world
these words spake jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, father, the hour is come; glorify thy son, that thy son also may glorify thee
as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
and this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true god, and jesus christ, whom thou hast sent
i have glorified thee on the earth
i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do
and now, o father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was
i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world
thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word
now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee
for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that i came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me
i pray for them
i pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine
and all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and i am glorified in them
and now i am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and i come to thee
holy father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are
while i was with them in the world, i kept them in thy name
those that thou gavest me i have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled
and now come i to thee; and these things i speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves
i have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as i am not of the world
i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
they are not of the world, even as i am not of the world
sanctify them through thy truth
thy word is truth
as thou hast sent me into the world, even so have i also sent them into the world
and for their sakes i sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth
neither pray i for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
that they all may be one; as thou, father, art in me, and i in thee, that they also may be one in us
that the world may believe that thou hast sent me
and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one
i in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me
father, i will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where i am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me
for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world
o righteous father, the world hath not known thee
but i have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me
and i have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and i in them
when jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples
and judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place
for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples
judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons
jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, whom seek ye?
they answered him, jesus of nazareth
jesus saith unto them, i am he
and judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them
as soon then as he had said unto them, i am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground
then asked he them again, whom seek ye? and they said, jesus of nazareth
jesus answered, i have told you that i am he
if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way
that the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, of them which thou gavest me have i lost none
then simon peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear
the servants name was malchus
then said jesus unto peter, put up thy sword into the sheath
the cup which my father hath given me, shall i not drink it?
then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus, and bound him,
and led him away to annas first; for he was father in law to caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year
now caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people
and simon peter followed jesus, and so did another disciple
that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest
but peter stood at the door without
then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in peter
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter, art not thou also one of this mans disciples? he saith, i am not
and the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold
and they warmed themselves
and peter stood with them, and warmed himself
the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine
jesus answered him, i spake openly to the world; i ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the jews always resort; and in secret have i said nothing
why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what i have said unto them
behold, they know what i said
and when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, answerest thou the high priest so?
jesus answered him, if i have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil
but if well, why smitest thou me?
now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest
and simon peter stood and warmed himself
they said therefore unto him, art not thou also one of his disciples? he denied it, and said, i am not
one of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off, saith, did not i see thee in the garden with him?
peter then denied again
and immediately the cock crew
then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment
and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover
pilate then went out unto them, and said, what accusation bring ye against this man?
they answered and said unto him, if he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee
then said pilate unto them, take ye him, and judge him according to your law
the jews therefore said unto him, it is not lawful for us to put any man to death
that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die
then pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called jesus, and said unto him, art thou the king of the jews?
jesus answered him, sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?
pilate answered, am i a jew? thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me
what hast thou done?
jesus answered, my kingdom is not of this world
if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that i should not be delivered to the jews
but now is my kingdom not from hence
pilate therefore said unto him, art thou a king then? jesus answered, thou sayest that i am a king
to this end was i born, and for this cause came i into the world, that i should bear witness unto the truth
every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
pilate saith unto him, what is truth? and when he had said this, he went out again unto the jews, and saith unto them, i find in him no fault at all
but ye have a custom, that i should release unto you one at the passover
will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews?
then cried they all again, saying, not this man, but barabbas
now barabbas was a robber
then pilate therefore took jesus, and scourged him
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
and said, hail, king of the jews! and they smote him with their hands
pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, behold, i bring him forth to you, that ye may know that i find no fault in him
then came jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe
and pilate saith unto them, behold the man!
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, crucify him, crucify him
pilate saith unto them, take ye him, and crucify him
for i find no fault in him
the jews answered him, we have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the son of god
when pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
and went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto jesus, whence art thou? but jesus gave him no answer
then saith pilate unto him, speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
jesus answered, thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above
therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin
and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him
but the jews cried out, saying, if thou let this man go, thou art not caesars friend
whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar
when pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement, but in the hebrew, gabbatha
and it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour
and he saith unto the jews, behold your king!
but they cried out, away with him, away with him, crucify him
pilate saith unto them, shall i crucify your king? the chief priest answered, we have no king but caesar
then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified
and they took jesus, and led him away
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the hebrew golgotha
where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and jesus in the midst
and pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross
and the writing was, jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
this title then read many of the jews
for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city
and it was written in hebrew, and greek, and latin
then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate, write not, the king of the jews; but that he said, i am king of the jews
pilate answered, what i have written i have written
then the soldiers, when they had crucified jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat
now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout
they said therefore among themselves, let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be
that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, they parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots
these things therefore the soldiers did
now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother, and his mothers sister, mary the wife of cleophas, and mary magdalene
when jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, woman, behold thy son!
then saith he to the disciple, behold thy mother! and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home
after this, jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, i thirst
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar
and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, it is finished
and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost
the jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day,  besought pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away
then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him
but when they came to jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs
but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water
and he that saw it bare record, and his record is true
and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe
for these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken
and again another scripture saith, they shall look on him whom they pierced
and after this joseph of arimathaea, being a disciple of jesus, but secretly for fear of the jews, besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus
and pilate gave him leave
he came therefore, and took the body of jesus
and there came also nicodemus, which at the first came to jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight
then took they the body of jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the jews is to bury
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid
there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre
then she runneth, and cometh to simon peter, and to the other disciple, whom jesus loved, and saith unto them, they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him
peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre
so they ran both together
and the other disciple did outrun peter, and came first to the sepulchre
and he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in
then cometh simon peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself
then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed
for as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead
then the disciples went away again unto their own home
but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping
and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of jesus had lain
and they say unto her, woman, why weepest thou? she saith unto them, because they have taken away my lord, and i know not where they have laid him
and when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw jesus standing, and knew not that it was jesus
jesus saith unto her, woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? she, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and i will take him away
jesus saith unto her, mary
she turned herself, and saith unto him, rabboni; which is to say, master
jesus saith unto her, touch me not; for i am not yet ascended to my father
but go to my brethren, and say unto them, i ascend unto my father, and your father; and to my god, and your god
mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her
then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews, came jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, peace be unto you
and when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side
then were the disciples glad, when they saw the lord
then said jesus to them again, peace be unto you
as my father hath sent me, even so send i you
and when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, receive ye the holy ghost
whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained
but thomas, one of the twelve, called didymus, was not with them when jesus came
the other disciples therefore said unto him, we have seen the lord
but he said unto them, except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, i will not believe
and after eight days again his disciples were within, and thomas with them
then came jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, peace be unto you
then saith he to thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side
and be not faithless, but believing
and thomas answered and said unto him, my lord and my god
jesus saith unto him, thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed
blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed
and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book
but these are written, that ye might believe that jesus is the christ, the son of god; and that believing ye might have life through his name
after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself
there were together simon peter, and thomas called didymus, and nathanael of cana in galilee, and the sons of zebedee, and two other of his disciples
simon peter saith unto them, i go a fishing
they say unto him, we also go with thee
they went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing
but when the morning was now come, jesus stood on the shore
but the disciples knew not that it was jesus
then jesus saith unto them, children, have ye any meat? they answered him, no
and he said unto them, cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find
they cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes
therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter, it is the lord
now when simon peter heard that it was the lord, he girt his fishers coat unto him,  and did cast himself into the sea
and the other disciples came in a little ship;  dragging the net with fishes
as soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread
jesus saith unto them, bring of the fish which ye have now caught
simon peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three
and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken
jesus saith unto them, come and dine
and none of the disciples durst ask him, who art thou? knowing that it was the lord
jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise
this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead
so when they had dined, jesus saith to simon peter, simon, son of jonas, lovest thou me more than these? he saith unto him, yea, lord; thou knowest that i love thee
he saith unto him, feed my lambs
he saith to him again the second time, simon, son of jonas, lovest thou me? he saith unto him, yea, lord; thou knowest that i love thee
he saith unto him, feed my sheep
he saith unto him the third time, simon, son of jonas, lovest thou me? peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, lovest thou me? and he said unto him, lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that i love thee
jesus saith unto him, feed my sheep
verily, verily, i say unto thee, when thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest
but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not
this spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify god
and when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, follow me
then peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
peter seeing him saith to jesus, lord, and what shall this man do?
jesus saith unto him, if i will that he tarry till i come, what is that to thee? follow thou me
then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die
yet jesus said not unto him, he shall not die; but, if i will that he tarry till i come, what is that to thee?
this is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things
and we know that his testimony is true
and there are also many other things which jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written
amen
the former treatise have i made, o theophilus, of all that jesus began both to do and teach,
until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god
and, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me
for john truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel?
and he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the father hath put in his own power
but ye shall receive power, after that the holy ghost is come upon you
and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem, and in all judaea, and in samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth
and when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight
and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
which also said, ye men of galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet, which is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey
and when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both peter, and james, and john, and andrew, philip, and thomas, bartholomew, and matthew, james the son of alphaeus, and simon zelotes, and judas the brother of james
these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and mary the mother of jesus, and with his brethren
and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, 
men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas, which was guide to them that took jesus
for he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry
now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out
and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, aceldama, that is to say, the field of blood
for it is written in the book of psalms, let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein
and his bishoprick let another take
wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us,
beginning from the baptism of john, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
and they appointed two, joseph called barsabas, who was surnamed justus, and matthias
and they prayed, and said, thou, lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,
that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place
and they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
and when the day of pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting
and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them
and they were all filled with the holy ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance
and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven
now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language
and they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, behold, are not all these which speak galilaeans?
and how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
parthians, and medes, and elamites, and the dwellers in mesopotamia, and in judaea, and cappadocia, in pontus, and asia,
phrygia, and pamphylia, in egypt, and in the parts of libya about cyrene, and strangers of rome, jews and proselytes,
cretes and arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god
and they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, what meaneth this?
others mocking said, these men are full of new wine
but peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, ye men of judaea, and all ye that dwell at jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words
for these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day
but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel;
and it shall come to pass in the last days, saith god,i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams
and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit; and they shall prophesy
and i will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke
the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the lord come
and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
ye men of israel, hear these words; jesus of nazareth, a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which god did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know
him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain
whom god hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death
because it was not possible that he should be holden of it
for david speaketh concerning him, i foresaw the lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that i should not be moved
therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption
thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance
men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day
therefore being a prophet, and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up christ to sit on his throne;
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption
this jesus hath god raised up, whereof we all are witnesses
therefore being by the right hand of god exalted, and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear
for david is not ascended into the heavens
but he saith himself, the lord said unto my lord, sit thou on my right hand,
until i make thy foes thy footstool
therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly, that god hath made that same jesus, whom ye have crucified, both lord and christ
now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do?
then peter said unto them, repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the lord our god shall call
and with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, save yourselves from this untoward generation
then they that gladly received his word were baptized
and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers
and fear came upon every soul
and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles
and all that believed were together, and had all things common;
and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need
and they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
praising god, and having favour with all the people
and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved
now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour
and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms
and peter, fastening his eyes upon him with john, said, look on us
and he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them
then peter said, silver and gold have i none; but such as i have give i thee
in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk
and he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up
and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength
and he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising god
and all the people saw him walking and praising god
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple
and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him
and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomons, greatly wondering
and when peter saw it, he answered unto the people, ye men of israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
the god of abraham, and of isaac, and of jacob, the god of our fathers, hath glorified his son jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of pilate, when he was determined to let him go
but ye denied the holy one and the just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;
and killed the prince of life, whom god hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know
yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all
and now, brethren, i wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers
but those things, which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled
repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord;
and he shall send jesus christ, which before was preached unto you
whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began
for moses truly said unto the fathers, a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you
and it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people
yea, and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days
ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which god made with our fathers, saying unto abraham, and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed
unto you first god, having raised up his son jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities
and as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the sadducees, came upon them,
being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead
and they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day
for it was now eventide
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand
and it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
and annas the high priest, and caiaphas, and john, and alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at jerusalem
and when they had set them in the midst, they asked, by what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
then peter, filled with the holy ghost, said unto them, ye rulers of the people, and elders of israel,
if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
be it known unto you all, and to all the people of israel, that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom god raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole
this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner
neither is there salvation in any other
for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved
now when they saw the boldness of peter and john, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with jesus
and beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
saying, what shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem; and we cannot deny it
but that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name
and they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus
but peter and john answered and said unto them, whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god, judge ye
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard
so when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people
for all men glorified god for that which was done
for the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed
and being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them
and when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to god with one accord, and said, lord, thou art god, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is
who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said, why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the lord, and against his christ
for of a truth against thy holy child jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both herod, and pontius pilate, with the gentiles, and the people of israel, were gathered together,
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done
and now, lord, behold their threatenings
and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
by stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus
and when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the holy ghost, and they spake the word of god with boldness
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul
neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common
and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus
and great grace was upon them all
neither was there any among them that lacked
for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
and laid them down at the apostles feet
and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
and joses, who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas,  a levite, and of the country of cyprus,
having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles feet
but a certain man named ananias, with sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles feet
but peter said, ananias, why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto god
and ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost
and great fear came on all them that heard these things
and the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him
and it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in
and peter answered unto her, tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? and she said, yea, for so much
then peter said unto her, how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out
then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost
and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband
and great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in solomons porch
and of the rest durst no man join himself to them
but the people magnified them
and believers were the more added to the lord, multitudes both of men and women
)
insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits
and they were healed every one
then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,  and were filled with indignation,
and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison
but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life
and when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught
but the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
but when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
saying, the prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors
but when we had opened, we found no man within
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow
then came one and told them, saying, behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people
then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence
for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned
and when they had brought them, they set them before the council
and the high priest asked them,
saying, did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us
then peter and the other apostles answered and said, we ought to obey god rather than men
the god of our fathers raised up jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour, for to give repentance to israel, and forgiveness of sins
and we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the holy ghost, whom god hath given to them that obey him
when they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them
then stood there up one in the council, a pharisee, named gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;
and said unto them, ye men of israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men
for before these days rose up theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves
who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him
he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed
and now i say unto you, refrain from these men, and let them alone
for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought
but if it be of god, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against god
and to him they agreed
and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus, and let them go
and they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name
and daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ
and in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, it is not reason that we should leave the word of god, and serve tables
wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the holy ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word
and the saying pleased the whole multitude
and they chose stephen, a man full of faith and of the holy ghost, and philip, and prochorus, and nicanor, and timon, and parmenas, and nicolas a proselyte of antioch
whom they set before the apostles
and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them
and the word of god increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
and stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people
then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the libertines, and cyrenians, and alexandrians, and of them of cilicia and of asia, disputing with stephen
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake
then they suborned men, which said, we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses, and against god
and they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,
and set up false witnesses, which said, this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law
for we have heard him say, that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which moses delivered us
and all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel
then said the high priest, are these things so?
and he said, men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham, when he was in mesopotamia, before he dwelt in charran,
and said unto him, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which i shall shew thee
then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans, and dwelt in charran
and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell
and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on
yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child
and god spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years
and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge, said god
and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place
and he gave him the covenant of circumcision
and so abraham begat isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and isaac begat jacob; and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs
and the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold joseph into egypt
but god was with him,
and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt; and he made him governor over egypt and all his house
now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan, and great affliction
and our fathers found no sustenance
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt, he sent out our fathers first
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren; and josephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh
then sent joseph, and called his father jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls
so jacob went down into egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
and were carried over into sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem
but when the time of the promise drew nigh, which god had sworn to abraham, the people grew and multiplied in egypt,
till another king arose, which knew not joseph
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live
in which time moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his fathers house three months
and when he was cast out, pharaohs daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son
and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds
and when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel
and seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the egyptian
for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them
but they understood not
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday?
then fled moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of madian, where he begat two sons
and when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush
when moses saw it, he wondered at the sight
and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the lord came unto him,
saying, i am the god of thy fathers, the god of abrham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob
then moses trembled, and durst not behold
then said the lord to him, put off thy shoes from thy feet
for the place where thou standest is holy ground
i have seen, i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt, and i have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them
and now come, i will send thee into egypt
this moses whom they refused, saying, who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush
he brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wilderness forty years
this is that moses, which said unto the children of israel, a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear
this is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina, and with our fathers
who received the lively oracles to give unto us
to whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into egypt,
saying unto aaron, make us gods to go before us
for as for this moses, which brought us out of the land of egypt, we wot not what is become of him
and they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands
then god turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, o ye house of israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
yea, ye took up the tabernacle of moloch, and the star of your god remphan, figures which ye made to worship them
and i will carry you away beyond babylon
our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen
which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles, whom god drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of david;
who found favour before god, and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob
but solomon built him an house
howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool
what house will ye build me? saith the lord
or what is the place of my rest?
hath not my hand made all these things?
ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the holy ghost
as your fathers did, so do ye
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers
who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it
when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth
but he, being full of the holy ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of god, and jesus standing on the right hand of god,
and said, behold, i see the heavens opened, and the son of man standing on the right hand of god
then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
and cast him out of the city, and stoned him
and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet, whose name was saul
and they stoned stephen, calling upon god, and saying, lord jesus, receive my spirit
and he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, lord, lay not this sin to their charge
and when he had said this, he fell asleep
and saul was consenting unto his death
and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria, except the apostles
and devout men carried stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him
as for saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison
therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word
then philip went down to the city of samaria, and preached christ unto them
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did
for unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them
and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed
and there was great joy in that city
but there was a certain man, called simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of samaria, giving out that himself was some great one
to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, this man is the great power of god
and to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries
but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god, and the name of jesus christ, they were baptized, both men and women
then simon himself believed also
and when he was baptized, he continued with philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done
now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god, they sent unto them peter and john
who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the holy ghost

then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy ghost
and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given, he offered them money,
saying, give me also this power, that on whomsoever i lay hands, he may receive the holy ghost
but peter said unto him, thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter
for thy heart is not right in the sight of god
repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray god, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee
for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity
then answered simon, and said, pray ye to the lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me
and they, when they had testified and preached the word of the lord, returned to jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans
and the angel of the lord spake unto philip, saying, arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza, which is desert
and he arose and went
and, behold, a man of ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to jerusalem for to worship,
was returning, and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet
then the spirit said unto philip, go near, and join thyself to this chariot
and philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet esaias, and said, understandest thou what thou readest?
and he said, how can i, except some man should guide me? and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him
the place of the scripture which he read was this, he was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away
and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth
and the eunuch answered philip, and said, i pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
then philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him jesus
and as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water
and the eunuch said, see, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
and philip said, if thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest
and he answered and said, i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
and he commanded the chariot to stand still
and they went down both into the water, both philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him
and when they were come up out of the water, the spirit of the lord caught away philip, that the eunuch saw him no more
and he went on his way rejoicing
but philip was found at azotus
and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to caesarea
and saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord, went unto the high priest,
and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto jerusalem
and as he journeyed, he came near damascus
and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven
and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me?
and he said, who art thou, lord? and the lord said, i am jesus whom thou persecutest
it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
and he trembling and astonished said, lord, what wilt thou have me to do? and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do
and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man
and saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man
but they led him by the hand, and brought him into damascus
and he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink
and there was a certain disciple at damascus, named ananias; and to him said the lord in a vision, ananias
and he said, behold, i am here, lord
and the lord said unto him, arise, and go into the street which is called straight, and inquire in the house of judas for one called saul, of tarsus
for, behold, he prayeth,
and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight
then ananias answered, lord, i have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name
but the lord said unto him, go thy way
for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the gentiles, and kings, and the children of israel
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names sake
and ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, brother saul, the lord, even jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy ghost
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales
and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized
and when he had received meat, he was strengthened
then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus
and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues, that he is the son of god
but all that heard him were amazed, and said; is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
but saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus, proving that this is very christ
and after that many days were fulfilled, the jews took counsel to kill him
but their laying await was known of saul
and they watched the gates day and night to kill him
then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket
and when saul was come to jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples
but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple
but barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus
and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem
and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus, and disputed against the grecians
but they went about to slay him
which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to caesarea, and sent him forth to tarsus
then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the lord, and in the comfort of the holy ghost, were multiplied
and it came to pass, as peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda
and there he found a certain man named aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy
and peter said unto him, aeneas, jesus christ maketh thee whole
arise, and make thy bed
and he arose immediately
and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him, and turned to the lord
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha, which by interpretation is called dorcas
this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did
and it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died
whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber
and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa, and the disciples had heard that peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them
then peter arose and went with them
when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber
and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made, while she was with them
but peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, tabitha, arise
and she opened her eyes
and when she saw peter, she sat up
and he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive
and it was known throughout all joppa; and many believed in the lord
and it came to pass, that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner
there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius, a centurion of the band called the italian band,
a devout man, and one that feared god with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to god alway
he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him, and saying unto him, cornelius
and when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, what is it, lord? and he said unto him, thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god
and now send men to joppa, and call for one simon, whose surname is peter
he lodgeth with one simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side
he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do
and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to joppa
on the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour
and he became very hungry, and would have eaten
but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air
and there came a voice to him, rise, peter; kill, and eat
but peter said, not so, lord; for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean
and the voice spake unto him again the second time, what god hath cleansed, that call not thou common
this was done thrice
and the vessel was received up again into heaven
now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from cornelius had made inquiry for simons house, and stood before the gate,
and called, and asked whether simon, which was surnamed peter, were lodged there
while peter thought on the vision, the spirit said unto him, behold, three men seek thee
arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing
for i have sent them
then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius; and said, behold, i am he whom ye seek
what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
and they said, cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth god, and of good report among all the nation of the jews, was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee
then called he them in, and lodged them
and on the morrow peter went away with them, and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him
and the morrow after they entered into caesarea
and cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends
and as peter was coming in, cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him
but peter took him up, saying, stand up; i myself also am a man
and as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together
and he said unto them, ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean
therefore came i unto you without gainsaying, as soon as i was sent for
i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
and cornelius said, four days ago i was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
and said, cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god
send therefore to joppa, and call hither simon, whose surname is peter; he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side
who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee
immediately therefore i sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come
now therefore are we all here present before god, to hear all things that are commanded thee of god
then peter opened his mouth, and said, of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons
but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him
the word which god sent unto the children of israel, preaching peace by jesus christ
that word, i say, ye know, which was published throughout all judaea, and began from galilee, after the baptism which john preached;
how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power
who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for god was with him
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews, and in jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree
him god raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of god, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
and he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead
to him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
while peter yet spake these words, the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with peter, because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost
for they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify god
then answered peter,
can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the holy ghost as well as we?
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord
then prayed they him to tarry certain days
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god
and when peter was come up to jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
saying, thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them
but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,
i was in the city of joppa praying
and in a trance i saw a vision, a certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me
upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes, i considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air
and i heard a voice saying unto me, arise, peter; slay and eat
but i said, not so, lord
for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth
but the voice answered me again from heaven, what god hath cleansed, that call not thou common
and this was done three times
and all were drawn up again into heaven
and, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was, sent from caesarea unto me
and the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting
moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the mans house
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, send men to joppa, and call for simon, whose surname is peter;
who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved
and as i began to speak, the holy ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning
then remembered i the word of the lord, how that he said, john indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the lord jesus christ; what was i, that i could withstand god?
when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified god, saying, then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice, and cyprus, and antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the jews only
and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene, which, when they were come to antioch, spake unto the grecians, preaching the lord jesus
and the hand of the lord was with them
and a great number believed, and turned unto the lord
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem
and they sent forth barnabas, that he should go as far as antioch
who, when he came, and had seen the grace of god, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord
for he was a good man, and full of the holy ghost and of faith
and much people was added unto the lord
then departed barnabas to tarsus, for to seek saul
and when he had found him, he brought him unto antioch
and it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people
and the disciples were called christians first in antioch
and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch
and there stood up one of them named agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world
which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar
then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea
which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword
and because he saw it pleased the jews, he proceeded further to take peter also
and when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after easter to bring him forth to the people
peter therefore was kept in prison
but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him
and when herod would have brought him forth, the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains
and the keepers before the door kept the prison
and, behold, the angel of the lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison
and he smote peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, arise up quickly
and his chains fell off from his hands
and the angel said unto him, gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals
and so he did
and he saith unto him, cast thy garment about thee, and follow me
and he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision
when they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord
and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him
and when peter was come to himself, he said, now i know of a surety, that the lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the jews
and when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of mary the mother of john, whose surname was mark; where many were gathered together praying
and as peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named rhoda
and when she knew peters voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how peter stood before the gate
and they said unto her, thou art mad
but she constantly affirmed that it was even so
then said they, it is his angel
but peter continued knocking
and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished
but he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison
and he said, go shew these things unto james, and to the brethren
and he departed, and went into another place
now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of peter
and when herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death
and he went down from judaea to caesarea, and there abode
and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon
but they came with one accord to him, and, having made blastus the kings chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the kings country
and upon a set day herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them
and the people gave a shout, saying, it is the voice of a god, and not of a man
and immediately the angel of the lord smote him, because he gave not god the glory
and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost
but the word of god grew and multiplied
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them john, whose surname was mark
now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers; as barnabas, and simeon that was called niger, and lucius of cyrene, and manaen, which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch, and saul
as they ministered to the lord, and fasted, the holy ghost said, separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them
and when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away
so they, being sent forth by the holy ghost, departed unto seleucia; and from thence they sailed to cyprus
and when they were at salamis, they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews
and they had also john to their minister
and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a jew, whose name was bar-jesus
which was with the deputy of the country, sergius paulus, a prudent man; who called for barnabas and saul, and desired to hear the word of god
but elymas the sorcerer  withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith
then saul,  filled with the holy ghost, set his eyes on him,
and said, o full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord?
and now, behold, the hand of the lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season
and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand
then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the lord
now when paul and his company loosed from paphos, they came to perga in pamphylia
and john departing from them returned to jerusalem
but when they departed from perga, they came to antioch in pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down
and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on
then paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, men of israel, and ye that fear god, give audience
the god of this people of israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it
and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until samuel the prophet
and afterward they desired a king
and god gave unto them saul the son of cis, a man of the tribe of benjamin, by the space of forty years
and when he had removed him, he raised up unto them david to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, i have found david the son of jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will
of this mans seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour, jesus
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
and as john fulfilled his course, he said, whom think ye that i am? i am not he
but, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose
men and brethren, children of the stock of abraham, and whosoever among you feareth god, to you is the word of this salvation sent
for they that dwell at jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him
and though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they pilate that he should be slain
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre
but god raised him from the dead
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people
and we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, thou art my son, this day have i begotten thee
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, i will give you the sure mercies of david
wherefore he saith also in another psalm, thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption
for david, after he had served his own generation by the will of god, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption
but he, whom god raised again, saw no corruption
be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins
and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses
beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish
for i work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you
and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue, the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
now when the congregation was broken up, many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas
who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of god
and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god
but when the jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by paul, contradicting and blaspheming
then paul and barnabas waxed bold, and said, it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you
but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the gentiles
for so hath the lord commanded us, saying, i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth
and when the gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the lord
and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed
and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region
but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against paul and barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto iconium
and the disciples were filled with joy, and with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed
but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren
long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands
but the multitude of the city was divided
and part held with the jews, and part with the apostles
and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles, and also of the jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,
they were ware of it, and fled unto lystra and derbe, cities of lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about
and there they preached the gospel
and there sat a certain man at lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mothers womb, who never had walked
the same heard paul speak
who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
said with a loud voice, stand upright on thy feet
and he leaped and walked
and when the people saw what paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of lycaonia, the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men
and they called barnabas, jupiter; and paul, mercurius, because he was the chief speaker
then the priest of jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people
which when the apostles, barnabas and paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
and saying, sirs, why do ye these things? we also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein
who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways
nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them
and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead
howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city
and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe
and when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to lystra, and to iconium, and antioch,
confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
and when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the lord, on whom they believed
and after they had passed throughout pisidia, they came to pamphylia
and when they had preached the word in perga, they went down into attalia
and thence sailed to antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled
and when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that god had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles
and there they abode long time with the disciples
and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren, and said, except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses, ye cannot be saved
when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that paul and barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question
and being brought on their way by the church, they passed through phenice and samaria, declaring the conversion of the gentiles
and they caused great joy unto all the brethren
and when they were come to jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that god had done with them
but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed, saying, that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of moses
and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter
and when there had been much disputing, peter rose up, and said unto them, men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us, that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe
and god, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the holy ghost, even as he did unto us;
and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith
now therefore why tempt ye god, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved, even as they
then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to barnabas and paul, declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them
and after they had held their peace, james answered, saying, men and brethren, hearken unto me
simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name
and to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
after this i will return, and will build again the tabernacle of david, which is fallen down; and i will build again the ruins thereof, and i will set it up
that the residue of men might seek after the lord, and all the gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the lord, who doeth all these things
known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world
wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the gentiles are turned to god
but that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day
then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas; namely, judas surnamed barsabas, and silas, chief men among the brethren
and they wrote letters by them after this manner; the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia
forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, ye must be circumcised, and keep the law
to whom we gave no such commandment
it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul,
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
we have sent therefore judas and silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth
for it seemed good to the holy ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication
from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well
fare ye well
so when they were dismissed, they came to antioch
and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle
which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation
and judas and silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them
and after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles
notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still
paul also and barnabas continued in antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the lord, with many others also
and some days after paul said unto barnabas, let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord, and see how they do
and barnabas determined to take with them john, whose surname was mark
but paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from pamphylia, and went not with them to the work
and the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other
and so barnabas took mark, and sailed unto cyprus;
and paul chose silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god
and he went through syria and cilicia, confirming the churches
then came he to derbe and lystra
and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a jewess, and believed; but his father was a greek
which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium
him would paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters
for they knew all that his father was a greek
and as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem
and so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily
now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia, and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia,
after they were come to mysia, they assayed to go into bithynia
but the spirit suffered them not
and they passing by mysia came down to troas
and a vision appeared to paul in the night; there stood a man of macedonia, and prayed him, saying, come over into macedonia, and help us
and after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into macedonia, assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them
therefore loosing from troas, we came with a straight course to samothracia, and the next day to neapolis;
and from thence to philippi, which is the chief city of that part of macedonia, and a colony
and we were in that city abiding certain days
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither
and a certain woman named lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of thyatira, which worshipped god, heard us
whose heart the lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul
and when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord, come into my house, and abide there
and she constrained us
and it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying
the same followed paul and us, and cried, saying, these men are the servants of the most high god, which shew unto us the way of salvation
and this did she many days
but paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her
and he came out the same hour
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught paul and silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,
and brought them to the magistrates, saying, these men, being jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being romans
and the multitude rose up together against them
and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them
and when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely
who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks
and at midnight paul and silas prayed, and sang praises unto god
and the prisoners heard them
and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken
and immediately all the doors were opened, and every ones bands were loosed
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled
but paul cried with a loud voice, saying, do thyself no harm
for we are all here
then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before paul and silas,
and brought them out, and said, sirs, what must i do to be saved?
and they said, believe on the lord jesus christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house
and they spake unto him the word of the lord, and to all that were in his house
and he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway
and when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in god with all his house
and when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, let those men go
and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul, the magistrates have sent to let you go
now therefore depart, and go in peace
but paul said unto them, they have beaten us openly uncondemned, being romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out
and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates
and they feared, when they heard that they were romans
and they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city
and they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia, they came to thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the jews
and paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
opening and alleging, that christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this jesus, whom i preach unto you, is christ
and some of them believed, and consorted with paul and silas; and of the devout greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few
but the jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of jason, and sought to bring them out to the people
and when they found them not, they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
whom jason hath received
and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar, saying that there is another king, one jesus
and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things
and when they had taken security of jason, and of the other, they let them go
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea
who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews
these were more noble than those in thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so
therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were greeks, and of men, not a few
but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people
and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea
but silas and timotheus abode there still
and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens
and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed
now while paul waited for them at athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him
then certain philosophers of the epicureans, and of the stoicks, encountered him
and some said, what will this babbler say? other some, he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods
because he preached unto them jesus, and the resurrection
and they took him, and brought him unto areopagus, saying, may we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?
for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears
we would know therefore what these things mean

then paul stood in the midst of mars hill, and said, ye men of athens, i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious
for as i passed by, and beheld your devotions, i found an altar with this inscription, to the unknown god
whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare i unto you
god that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
neither is worshipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
that they should seek the lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us
for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, for we are also his offspring
forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god, we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and mans device
and the times of this ignorance god winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent
because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked
and others said, we will hear thee again of this matter
so paul departed from among them
howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed
among the which was dionysius the areopagite, and a woman named damaris, and others with them
after these things paul departed from athens, and came to corinth;
and found a certain jew named aquila, born in pontus, lately come from italy, with his wife priscilla;  and came unto them
and because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought
for by their occupation they were tentmakers
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the jews and the greeks
and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia, paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the jews that jesus was christ
and when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, your blood be upon your own heads; i am clean
from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles
and he departed thence, and entered into a certain mans house, named justus, one that worshipped god, whose house joined hard to the synagogue
and crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the lord with all his house; and many of the corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized
then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision, be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace
for i am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee
for i have much people in this city
and he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of god among them
and when gallio was the deputy of achaia, the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
saying, this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law
and when paul was now about to open his mouth, gallio said unto the jews, if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, o ye jews, reason would that i should bear with you
but if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for i will be no judge of such matters
and he drave them from the judgment seat
then all the greeks took sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat
and gallio cared for none of those things
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into syria, and with him priscilla and aquila; having shorn his head in cenchrea
for he had a vow
and he came to ephesus, and left them there
but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the jews
when they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
but bade them farewell, saying, i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem
but i will return again unto you, if god will
and he sailed from ephesus
and when he had landed at caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to antioch
and after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples
and a certain jew named apollos, born at alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to ephesus
this man was instructed in the way of the lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord, knowing only the baptism of john
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue
whom when aquila and priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly
and when he was disposed to pass into achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him
who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace
for he mightily convinced the jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ
and it came to pass, that, while apollos was at corinth, paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus
and finding certain disciples,
he said unto them, have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed? and they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost
and he said unto them, unto what then were ye baptized? and they said, unto johns baptism
then said paul, john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on christ jesus
when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
and when paul had laid his hands upon them, the holy ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied
and all the men were about twelve
and he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god
but when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus
and this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus, both jews and greeks
and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul
so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them
then certain of the vagabond jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus, saying, we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth
and there were seven sons of one sceva, a jew, and chief of the priests, which did so
and the evil spirit answered and said, jesus i know, and paul i know; but who are ye?
and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded
and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the lord jesus was magnified
and many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men
and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver
so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed
after these things were ended, paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through macedonia and achaia, to go to jerusalem, saying, after i have been there, i must also see rome
so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, timotheus and erastus; but he himself stayed in asia for a season
and the same time there arose no small stir about that way
for a certain man named demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth
moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at ephesus, but almost throughout all asia, this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands
so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all asia and the world worshippeth
and when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, great is diana of the ephesians
and the whole city was filled with confusion
and having caught gaius and aristarchus, men of macedonia, pauls companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre
and when paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not
and certain of the chief of asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre
some therefore cried one thing, and some another
for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together
and they drew alexander out of the multitude, the jews putting him forward
and alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people
but when they knew that he was a jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, great is diana of the ephesians
and when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, ye men of ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana, and of the image which fell down from jupiter?
seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly
for ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess
wherefore if demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies
let them implead one another
but if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly
for we are in danger to be called in question for this days uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse
and when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly
and after the uproar was ceased, paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into macedonia
and when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into greece,
and there abode three months
and when the jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into syria, he purposed to return through macedonia
and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea; and of the thessalonians, aristarchus and secundus; and gaius of derbe, and timotheus; and of asia, tychicus and trophimus
these going before tarried for us at troas
and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to troas in five days; where we abode seven days
and upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight
and there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together
and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep
and as paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead
and paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him
when he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed
and they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted
and we went before to ship, and sailed unto assos, there intending to take in paul
for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot
and when he met with us at assos, we took him in, and came to mitylene
and we sailed thence, and came the next day over against chios; and the next day we arrived at samos, and tarried at trogyllium; and the next day we came to miletus
for paul had determined to sail by ephesus, because he would not spend the time in asia
for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost
and from miletus he sent to ephesus, and called the elders of the church
and when they were come to him, he said unto them, ye know, from the first day that i came into asia, after what manner i have been with you at all seasons,
serving the lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews
and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,
testifying both to the jews, and also to the greeks, repentance toward god, and faith toward our lord jesus christ
and now, behold, i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there
save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me
but none of these things move me, neither count i my life dear unto myself, so that i might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which i have received of the lord jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of god
and now, behold, i know that ye all, among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god, shall see my face no more
wherefore i take you to record this day, that i am pure from the blood of all men
for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god
take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of god, which he hath purchased with his own blood
for i know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock
also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them
therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears
and now, brethren, i commend you to god, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified
i have coveted no mans silver, or gold, or apparel
yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me
i have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the lord jesus, how he said, it is more blessed to give than to receive
and when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all
and they all wept sore, and fell on pauls neck, and kissed him,
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more
and they accompanied him unto the ship
and it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto coos, and the day following unto rhodes, and from thence unto patara
and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth
now when we had discovered cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into syria, and landed at tyre
for there the ship was to unlade her burden
and finding disciples, we tarried there seven days
who said to paul through the spirit, that he should not go up to jerusalem
and when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city
and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed
and when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again
and when we had finished our course from tyre, we came to ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day
and the next day we that were of pauls company departed, and came unto caesarea
and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him
and the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy
and as we tarried there many days, there came down from judaea a certain prophet, named agabus
and when he was come unto us, he took pauls girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, thus saith the holy ghost, so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles
and when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to jerusalem
then paul answered, what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for i am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
and when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, the will of the lord be done
and after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to jerusalem
there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea, and brought with them one mnason of cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge
and when we were come to jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly
and the day following paul went in with us unto james; and all the elders were present
and when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry
and when they heard it, they glorified the lord, and said unto him, thou seest, brother, how many thousands of jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law
and they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs
what is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together
for they will hear that thou art come
do therefore this that we say to thee
we have four men which have a vow on them;
them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads
and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law
as touching the gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication
then paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purifcation, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them
and when the seven days were almost ended, the jews which were of asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
crying out, men of israel, help
this is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place
and further brought greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place

and all the city was moved, and the people ran together
and they took paul, and drew him out of the temple
and forthwith the doors were shut
and as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all jerusalem was in an uproar
who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them
and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of paul
then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done
and some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude
and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle
and when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people
for the multitude of the people followed after, crying, away with him
and as paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, may i speak unto thee? who said, canst thou speak greek?
art not thou that egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
but paul said, i am a man which am a jew of tarsus, a city in cilicia, a citizen of no mean city
and, i beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people
and when he had given him licence, paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people
and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue, saying,
men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which i make now unto you

i am verily a man which am a jew, born in tarsus, a city in cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward god, as ye all are this day
and i persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women
as also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders
from whom also i received letters unto the brethren, and went to damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem, for to be punished
and it came to pass, that, as i made my journey, and was come nigh unto damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me
and i fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me?
and i answered, who art thou, lord? and he said unto me, i am jesus of nazareth, whom thou persecutest
and they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me
and i said, what shall i do, lord? and the lord said unto me, arise, and go into damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do
and when i could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, i came into damascus
and one ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there,
came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, brother saul, receive thy sight
and the same hour i looked up upon him
and he said, the god of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that just one, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard
and now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the lord
and it came to pass, that, when i was come again to jerusalem, even while i prayed in the temple, i was in a trance;
and saw him saying unto me, make haste, and get thee quickly out of jerusalem
for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me
and i said, lord, they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee
and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed, i also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him
and he said unto me, depart
for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles
and they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, away with such a fellow from the earth
for it is not fit that he should live
and as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him
and as they bound him with thongs, paul said unto the centurion that stood by, is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman, and uncondemned?
when the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, take heed what thou doest
for this man is a roman
then the chief captain came, and said unto him, tell me, art thou a roman? he said, yea
and the chief captain answered, with a great sum obtained i this freedom
and paul said, but i was free born
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him
and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a roman, and because he had bound him
on the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought paul down, and set him before them
and paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, men and brethren, i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth
then said paul unto him, god shall smite thee, thou whited wall
for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
and they that stood by said, revilest thou gods high priest?
then said paul, i wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest
for it is written, thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees, and the other pharisees, he cried out in the council, men and brethren, i am a pharisee, the son of a pharisee
of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question
and when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees
and the multitude was divided
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit
but the pharisees confess both
and there arose a great cry
and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose, and strove, saying, we find no evil in this man
but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against god
and when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle
and the night following the lord stood by him, and said, be of good cheer, paul
for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at rome
and when it was day, certain of the jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul
and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy
and they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, we have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul
now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him
and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him
and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told paul
then paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, bring this young man unto the chief captain
for he hath a certain thing to tell him
so he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee
then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, what is that thou hast to tell me?
and he said, the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly
but do not thou yield unto them
for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him
and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee
so the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me
and he called unto him two centurions, saying, make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
and provide them beasts, that they may set paul on, and bring him safe unto felix the governor
and he wrote a letter after this manner
claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting
this man was taken of the jews, and should have been killed of them
then came i with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a roman
and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, i brought him forth into their council
whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds
and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man, i sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him
farewell
then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took paul, and brought him by night to antipatris
on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle
who, when they came to caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented paul also before him
and when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was
and when he understood that he was of cilicia;
i will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come
and he commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall
and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named tertullus, who informed the governor against paul
and when he was called forth, tertullus began to accuse him, saying, seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
we accept it always, and in all places, most noble felix, with all thankfulness
notwithstanding, that i be not further tedious unto thee, i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words
for we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
who also hath gone about to profane the temple
whom we took, and would have judged according to our law
but the chief captain lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,
commanding his accusers to come unto thee
by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him
and the jews also assented, saying that these things were so
then paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, i do the more cheerfully answer for myself
because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship
and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city
neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me
but this i confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship i the god of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets
and have hope toward god, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust
and herein do i exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward god, and toward men
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings
whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult
who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me
or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while i stood before the council,
except it be for this one voice, that i cried standing among them, touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day
and when felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, when lysias the chief captain shall come down, i will know the uttermost of your matter
and he commanded a centurion to keep paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him
and after certain days, when felix came with his wife drusilla, which was a jewess, he sent for paul, and heard him concerning the faith in christ
and as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come felix trembled, and answered, go thy way for this time; when i have a convenient season, i will call for thee
he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul, that he might loose him
wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him
but after two years porcius festus came into felix room
and felix, willing to shew the jews a pleasure, left paul bound
now when festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem
then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul, and besought him,
and desired favour against him, that he would send for him to jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him
but festus answered, that paul should be kept at caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither
let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought
and when he was come, the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against paul, which they could not prove
while he answered for himself, neither against the law of the jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against caesar, have i offended any thing at all
but festus, willing to do the jews a pleasure, answered paul, and said, wilt thou go up to jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
then said paul, i stand at caesars judgment seat, where i ought to be judged
to the jews have i done no wrong, as thou very well knowest
for if i be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, i refuse not to die
but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them
i appeal unto caesar
then festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, hast thou appealed unto caesar? unto caesar shalt thou go
and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus
and when they had been there many days, festus declared pauls cause unto the king, saying, there is a certain man left in bonds by felix
about whom, when i was at jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him
to whom i answered, it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him
therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth
against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed
but had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one jesus, which was dead, whom paul affirmed to be alive
and because i doubted of such manner of questions, i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters
but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus, i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar
then agrippa said unto festus, i would also hear the man myself
to morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him
and on the morrow, when agrippa was come, and bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at festus commandment paul was brought forth
and festus said, king agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me, both at jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to augustus, i have determined to send him
of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord
wherefore i have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, o king agrippa, that, after examination had, i might have somewhat to write
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him
then agrippa said unto paul, thou art permitted to speak for thyself
then paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself
i think myself happy, king agrippa, because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews
especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews
wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently
my manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem, know all the jews;
which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee
and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers
unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving god day and night, hope to come
for which hopes sake, king agrippa, i am accused of the jews
why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that god should raise the dead?
i verily thought with myself, that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth
which thing i also did in jerusalem
and many of the saints did i shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, i gave my voice against them
and i punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, i persecuted them even unto strange cities
whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
at midday, o king, i saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me
and when we were all fallen to the earth, i heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the hebrew tongue, saul, saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
and i said, who art thou, lord? and he said, i am jesus whom thou persecutest
but rise, and stand upon thy feet
for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee;
delivering thee from the people, and from the gentiles, unto whom now i send thee,
to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto god, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me
whereupon, o king agrippa, i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
but shewed first unto them of damascus, and at jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of judaea, and then to the gentiles, that they should repent and turn to god, and do works meet for repentance
for these causes the jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me
having therefore obtained help of god, i continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come
that christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the gentiles
and as he thus spake for himself, festus said with a loud voice, paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad
but he said, i am not mad, most noble festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness
for the king knoweth of these things, before whom also i speak freely
for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner
king agrippa, believest thou the prophets? i know that thou believest
then agrippa said unto paul, almost thou persuadest me to be a christian
and paul said, i would to god, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as i am, except these bonds
and when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and bernice, and they that sat with them
and when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds
then said agrippa unto festus, this man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto caesar
and when it was determined that we should sail into italy, they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius, a centurion of augustus band
and entering into a ship of adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of asia; one aristarchus, a macedonian of thessalonica, being with us
and the next day we touched at sidon
and julius courteously entreated paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself
and when we had launched from thence, we sailed under cyprus, because the winds were contrary
and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia, we came to myra, a city of lycia
and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy; and he put us therein
and when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under crete, over against salmone;
and, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called the fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of lasea
now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, paul admonished them,
and said unto them, sirs, i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by paul
and because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west
and when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by crete
but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called euroclydon
and when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive
and running under a certain island which is called clauda, we had much work to come by the boat
which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven
and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away
but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from crete, and to have gained this harm and loss
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer
for there shall be no loss of any mans life among you, but of the ship
for there stood by me this night the angel of god, whose i am, and whom i serve,
saying, fear not, paul; thou must be brought before caesar
and, lo, god hath given thee all them that sail with thee
wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer
for i believe god, that it shall be even as it was told me
howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island
but when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
and sounded, and found it twenty fathoms
and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day
and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off
and while the day was coming on, paul besought them all to take meat, saying, this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing
wherefore i pray you to take some meat
for this is for your health
for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you
and when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to god in presence of them all
and when he had broken it, he began to eat
then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls
and when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea
and when it was day, they knew not the land
but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship
and when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore
and falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves
and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape
but the centurion, willing to save paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land
and the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship
and so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land
and when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called melita
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness
for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold
and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, no doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live
and he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm
howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly
but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously
and it came to pass, that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux
to whom paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him
so when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed
who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary
and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was castor and pollux
and landing at syracuse, we tarried there three days
and from thence we fetched a compass, and came to rhegium
and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to puteoli
where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days
and so we went toward rome
and from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as appiiforum, and the three taverns
whom when paul saw, he thanked god, and took courage
and when we came to rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard
but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him
and it came to pass, that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together
and when they were come together, he said unto them, men and brethren, though i have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me
but when the jews spake against it, i was constrained to appeal unto caesar; not that i had ought to accuse my nation of
for this cause therefore have i called for you, to see you, and to speak with you
because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain
and they said unto him, we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest
for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against
and when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god, persuading them concerning jesus, both out of the law of moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening
and some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not
and when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that paul had spoken one word, well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
saying, go unto this people, and say, hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive
for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and i should heal them
be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles, and that they will hear it
and when he had said these words, the jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
preaching the kingdom of god, and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him
paul, a servant of jesus christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of god,

concerning his son jesus christ our lord, which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh;
and declared to be the son of god with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead
by whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name
among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ
to all that be in rome, beloved of god, called to be saints
grace to you and peace from god our father, and the lord jesus christ
first, i thank my god through jesus christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world
for god is my witness, whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son, that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers;
making request, if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you
for i long to see you, that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
that is, that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
now i would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you,  that i might have some fruit among you also, even as among other gentiles
i am debtor both to the greeks, and to the barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise
so, as much as in me is, i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also
for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ
for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the jew first, and also to the greek
for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith
as it is written, the just shall live by faith
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
because that which may be known of god is manifest in them; for god hath shewed it unto them
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead; so that they are without excuse
because that, when they knew god, they glorified him not as god, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened
professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things
wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
who changed the truth of god into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator, who is blessed for ever
amen
for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections
for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature
and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet
and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge, god gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
backbiters, haters of god, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful
who knowing the judgment of god, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them
therefore thou art inexcusable, o man, whosoever thou art that judgest
for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things
but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things
and thinkest thou this, o man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of god?
or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance?
but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god;
who will render to every man according to his deeds
to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life
but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the jew first, and also of the gentile;
but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the jew first, and also to the gentile
for there is no respect of persons with god
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law
and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
(for not the hearers of the law are just before god, but the doers of the law shall be justified
for when the gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves
which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel
behold, thou art called a jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of god,
and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law
thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou god?
for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you, as it is written
for circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law
but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision
therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
for he is not a jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh
but he is a jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of god
what advantage then hath the jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
much every way
chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of god
for what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect?
god forbid
yea, let god be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged
but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god, what shall we say? is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance? 
god forbid
for then how shall god judge the world?
for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am i also judged as a sinner?
and not rather,  let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just
what then? are we better than they? no, in no wise
for we have before proved both jews and gentiles, that they are all under sin;
as it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one
there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after god
they are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one
their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips
whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
their feet are swift to shed blood
destruction and misery are in their ways
and the way of peace have they not known
there is no fear of god before their eyes
now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law
that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before god
therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight
for by the law is the knowledge of sin
but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe
for there is no difference
for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of god;
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of god;
to declare, i say, at this time his righteousness
that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus
where is boasting then? it is excluded
by what law? of works? nay
but by the law of faith
therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law
is he the god of the jews only? is he not also of the gentiles? yes, of the gentiles also
seeing it is one god, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith
do we then make void the law through faith? god forbid
yea, we establish the law
what shall we say then that abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
for if abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before god
for what saith the scripture? abraham believed god, and it was counted unto him for righteousness
now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt
but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness
even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works,
saying, blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered
blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin
cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness
how was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision
and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised
that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised
for the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith
for if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect
because the law worketh wrath
for where no law is, there is no transgression
therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of abraham; who is the father of us all,
 before him whom he believed, even god, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were
who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be
and being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of saras womb
he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to god;
and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform
and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness
now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead;
who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification
therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also
knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
and patience, experience; and experience, hope
and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us
for when we were yet without strength, in due time christ died for the ungodly
for scarcely for a righteous man will one die
yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die
but god commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, christ died for us
much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him
for if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to god by the death of his son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life
and not only so, but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ, by whom we have now received the atonement
wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned
(for until the law sin was in the world
but sin is not imputed when there is no law
nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come
but not as the offence, so also is the free gift
for if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of god, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, jesus christ, hath abounded unto many
and not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift
for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification
for if by one mans offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, jesus christ
)
therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life
for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous
moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound
but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound
that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord
what shall we say then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
god forbid
how shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death?
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death
that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in newness of life
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection
knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin
for he that is dead is freed from sin
now if we be dead with christ, we believe that we shall also live with him
knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him
for in that he died, he died unto sin once
but in that he liveth, he liveth unto god
likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord
let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
but yield yourselves unto god, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god
for sin shall not have dominion over you
for ye are not under the law, but under grace
what then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? god forbid
know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
but god be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you
being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness
i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh
for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness
for when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness
what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death
but now being made free from sin, and become servants to god, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life
for the wages of sin is death; but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
know ye not, brethren,  how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband
so then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress
but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man
wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto god
for when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death
but now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter
what shall we say then? is the law sin? god forbid
nay, i had not known sin, but by the law
for i had not known lust, except the law had said, thou shalt not covet
but sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence
for without the law sin was dead
for i was alive without the law once
but when the commandment came, sin revived, and i died
and the commandment, which was ordained to life, i found to be unto death
for sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me
wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good
was then that which is good made death unto me? god forbid
but sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful
for we know that the law is spiritual
but i am carnal, sold under sin
for that which i do i allow not
for what i would, that do i not; but what i hate, that do i
if then i do that which i would not, i consent unto the law that it is good
now then it is no more i that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me
for i know that in me  dwelleth no good thing
for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good i find not
for the good that i would i do not
but the evil which i would not, that i do
now if i do that i would not, it is no more i that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me
i find then a law, that, when i would do good, evil is present with me
for i delight in the law of god after the inward man
but i see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
o wretched man that i am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
i thank god through jesus christ our lord
so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god; but with the flesh the law of sin
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit
for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
for what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit
for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit
for to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace
because the carnal mind is enmity against god
for it is not subject to the law of god, neither indeed can be
so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god
but ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you
now if any man have not the spirit of christ, he is none of his
and if christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness
but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you
therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh
for if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die
but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live
for as many as are led by the spirit of god, they are the sons of god
for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, abba, father
the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of god
and if children, then heirs; heirs of god, and joint-heirs with christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together
for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god
for the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,
because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god
for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now
and not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body
for we are saved by hope
but hope that is seen is not hope
for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
but if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it
likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities
for we know not what we should pray for as we ought
but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god
and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god, to them who are the called according to his purpose
for whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren
moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called
and whom he called, them he also justified
and whom he justified, them he also glorified
what shall we then say to these things? if god be for us, who can be against us?
he that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect? it is god that justifieth
who is he that condemneth? it is christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of god, who also maketh intercession for us
who shall separate us from the love of christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
as it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us
for i am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of god, which is in christ jesus our lord
i say the truth in christ, i lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost,
that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart
for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh
who are israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of god, and the promises;
whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came, who is over all, god blessed for ever
amen
not as though the word of god hath taken none effect
for they are not all israel, which are of israel
neither, because they are the seed of abraham, are they all children
but, in isaac shall thy seed be called
that is, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of god
but the children of the promise are counted for the seed
for this is the word of promise, at this time will i come, and sara shall have a son
and not only this; but when rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father isaac;

it was said unto her, the elder shall serve the younger
as it is written, jacob have i loved, but esau have i hated
what shall we say then? is there unrighteousness with god? god forbid
for he saith to moses, i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy, and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion
so then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of god that sheweth mercy
for the scripture saith unto pharaoh, even for this same purpose have i raised thee up, that i might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth
therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth
thou wilt say then unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted his will?
nay but, o man, who art thou that repliest against god? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?
hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
what if god, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
even us, whom he hath called, not of the jews only, but also of the gentiles?
as he saith also in osee, i will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved
and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living god
esaias also crieth concerning israel, though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved
for he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness
because a short work will the lord make upon the earth
and as esaias said before, except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as sodoma, and been made like unto gomorrha
what shall we say then? that the gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith
but israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness
wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law
for they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
as it is written, behold, i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence
and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
brethren, my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is, that they might be saved
for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god, but not according to knowledge
for they being ignorant of gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god
for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, that the man which doeth those things shall live by them
but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven? 
or, who shall descend into the deep? 
but what saith it? the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart
that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved
for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
for the scripture saith, whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
for there is no difference between the jew and the greek
for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
and how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
but they have not all obeyed the gospel
for esaias saith, lord, who hath believed our report?
so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of god
but i say, have they not heard? yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world
but i say, did not israel know? first moses saith, i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation i will anger you
but esaias is very bold, and saith, i was found of them that sought me not; i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me
but to israel he saith, all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people
i say then, hath god cast away his people? god forbid
for i also am an israelite, of the seed of abraham, of the tribe of benjamin
god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew
wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias? how he maketh intercession to god against israel, saying,
lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and i am left alone, and they seek my life
but what saith the answer of god unto him? i have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
and if by grace, then is it no more of works
otherwise grace is no more grace
but if it be of works, then is it no more grace
otherwise work is no more work
what then? israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
 unto this day
and david saith, let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence unto them
let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway
i say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? god forbid
but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles; how much more their fulness?
for i speak to you gentiles, inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles, i magnify mine office
if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them
for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
for if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy
and if the root be holy, so are the branches
and if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
boast not against the branches
but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee
thou wilt say then, the branches were broken off, that i might be graffed in
well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith
be not highminded, but fear
for if god spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee
behold therefore the goodness and severity of god
on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness
otherwise thou also shalt be cut off
and they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in
for god is able to graff them in again
for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree
how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
for i would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to israel, until the fulness of the gentiles be come in
and so all israel shall be saved
as it is written, there shall come out of sion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob
for this is my covenant unto them, when i shall take away their sins
as concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes
but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers sakes
for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance
for as ye in times past have not believed god, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief
even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy
for god hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all
o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
for who hath known the mind of the lord? or who hath been his counseller?
or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
for of him, and through him, and to him, are all things
to whom be glory for ever
amen
i beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of god, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto god, which is your reasonable service
and be not conformed to this world
but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of god
for i say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith
for as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office
so we, being many, are one body in christ, and every one members one of another
having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
or ministry, let us wait on our ministering
or he that teacheth, on teaching;
or he that exhorteth, on exhortation
he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness
let love be without dissimulation
abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good
be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the lord;
rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality
bless them which persecute you
bless, and curse not
rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep
be of the same mind one toward another
mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate
be not wise in your own conceits
recompense to no man evil for evil
provide things honest in the sight of all men
if it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men
dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath
for it is written, vengeance is mine; i will repay, saith the lord
therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink
for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head
be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers
for there is no power but of god
the powers that be are ordained of god
whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of god
and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation
for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil
wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same
for he is the minister of god to thee for good
but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain
for he is the minister of god, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake
for for this cause pay ye tribute also
for they are gods ministers, attending continually upon this very thing
render therefore to all their dues
tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour
owe no man any thing, but to love one another
for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law
for this, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
love worketh no ill to his neighbour
therefore love is the fulfilling of the law
and that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep
for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed
the night is far spent, the day is at hand
let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light
let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying
but put ye on the lord jesus christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof
him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations
for one believeth that he may eat all things
another, who is weak, eateth herbs
let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth
for god hath received him
who art thou that judgest another mans servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth
yea, he shall be holden up
for god is able to make him stand
one man esteemeth one day above another
another esteemeth every day alike
let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind
he that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the lord he doth not regard it
he that eateth, eateth to the lord, for he giveth god thanks; and he that eateth not, to the lord he eateth not, and giveth god thanks
for none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself
for whether we live, we live unto the lord; and whether we die, we die unto the lord
whether we live therefore, or die, we are the lords
for to this end christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be lord both of the dead and living
but why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ
for it is written, as i live, saith the lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to god
so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god
let us not therefore judge one another any more
but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brothers way
i know, and am persuaded by the lord jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself
but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean
but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably
destroy not him with thy meat, for whom christ died
let not then your good be evil spoken of
for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy ghost
for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god, and approved of men
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another
for meat destroy not the work of god
all things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence
it is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak
hast thou faith? have it to thyself before god
happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth
and he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith
for whatsoever is not of faith is sin
we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves
let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification
for even christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me
for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope
now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify god, even the father of our lord jesus christ
wherefore receive ye one another, as christ also received us to the glory of god
now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy; as it is written, for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles, and sing unto thy name
and again he saith, rejoice, ye gentiles, with his people
and again, praise the lord, all ye gentiles; and laud him, all ye people
and again, esaias saith, there shall be a root of jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles; in him shall the gentiles trust
now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the holy ghost
and i myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another
nevertheless, brethren, i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of god,
that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles, ministering the gospel of god, that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy ghost
i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god
for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me, to make the gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the spirit of god; so that from jerusalem, and round about unto illyricum, i have fully preached the gospel of christ
yea, so have i strived to preach the gospel, not where christ was named, lest i should build upon another mans foundation
but as it is written, to whom he was not spoken of, they shall see
and they that have not heard shall understand
for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you
but now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
whensoever i take my journey into spain, i will come to you
for i trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first i be somewhat filled with your company
but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints
for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem
it hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are
for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things
when therefore i have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, i will come by you into spain
and i am sure that, when i come unto you, i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ
now i beseech you, brethren, for the lord jesus christs sake, and for the love of the spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me;
that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea; and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god, and may with you be refreshed
now the god of peace be with you all
amen
i commend unto you phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea
that ye receive her in the lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you
for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also
greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus
who have for my life laid down their own necks
unto whom not only i give thanks, but also all the churches of the gentiles
likewise greet the church that is in their house
salute my wellbeloved epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of achaia unto christ
greet mary, who bestowed much labour on us
salute andronicus and junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in christ before me
greet amplias my beloved in the lord
salute urbane, our helper in christ, and stachys my beloved
salute apelles approved in christ
salute them which are of aristobulus household
salute herodion my kinsman
greet them that be of the household of narcissus, which are in the lord
salute tryphena and tryphosa, who labour in the lord
salute the beloved persis, which laboured much in the lord
salute rufus chosen in the lord, and his mother and mine
salute asyncritus, phlegon, hermas, patrobas, hermes, and the brethren which are with them
salute philologus, and julia, nereus, and his sister, and olympas, and all the saints which are with them
salute one another with an holy kiss
the churches of christ salute you
now i beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them
for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men
i am glad therefore on your behalf
but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil
and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
amen
timotheus my workfellow, and lucius, and jason, and sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you
i tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the lord
gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you
erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and quartus a brother
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all
amen
now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of jesus christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
but now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting god, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith
to god only wise, be glory through jesus christ for ever
amen
paul, called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god, and sosthenes our brother,
unto the church of god which is at corinth, to them that are sanctified in christ jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord, both theirs and ours
grace be unto you, and peace, from god our father, and from the lord jesus christ
i thank my god always on your behalf, for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ;
that in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;
even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you
so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ
who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ
god is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord
now i beseech you, brethren, by the name of our lord jesus christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment
for it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of chloe, that there are contentions among you
now this i say, that every one of you saith, i am of paul; and i of apollos; and i of cephas; and i of christ
is christ divided? was paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of paul?
i thank god that i baptized none of you, but crispus and gaius;
lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name
and i baptized also the household of stephanas
besides, i know not whether i baptized any other
for christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel
not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of god
for it is written, i will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent
where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world?
for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god, it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe
for the jews require a sign, and the greeks seek after wisdom
but we preach christ crucified, unto the jews a stumblingblock, and unto the greeks foolishness;
but unto them which are called, both jews and greeks, christ the power of god, and the wisdom of god
because the foolishness of god is wiser than men; and the weakness of god is stronger than men
for ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called
but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath god chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are
that no flesh should glory in his presence
but of him are ye in christ jesus, who of god is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption
that, according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the lord
and i, brethren, when i came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of god
for i determined not to know any thing among you, save jesus christ, and him crucified
and i was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling
and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of god
howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect
yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought
but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which god ordained before the world unto our glory
which none of the princes of this world knew
for had they known it, they would not have crucified the lord of glory
but as it is written, eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which god hath prepared for them that love him
but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
for the spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of god
for what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of god knoweth no man, but the spirit of god
now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of god; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god
which things also we speak, not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth, but which the holy ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual
but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god
for they are foolishness unto him
neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned
but he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man
for who hath known the mind of the lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of christ
and i, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in christ
i have fed you with milk, and not with meat
for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able
for ye are yet carnal
for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
for while one saith, i am of paul; and another, i am of apollos; are ye not carnal?
who then is paul, and who is apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the lord gave to every man?
i have planted, apollos watered; but god gave the increase
so then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but god that giveth the increase
now he that planteth and he that watereth are one
and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour
for we are labourers together with god
ye are gods husbandry, ye are gods building
according to the grace of god which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, i have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon
but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon
for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is jesus christ
now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
every mans work shall be made manifest
for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is
if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward
if any mans work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss
but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire
know ye not that ye are the temple of god, and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you?
if any man defile the temple of god, him shall god destroy; for the temple of god is holy, which temple ye are
let no man deceive himself
if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god
for it is written, he taketh the wise in their own craftiness
and again, the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain
therefore let no man glory in men
for all things are yours;
whether paul, or apollos, or cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
and ye are christs; and christ is gods
let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of christ, and stewards of the mysteries of god
moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful
but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you, or of mans judgment
yea, i judge not mine own self
for i know nothing by myself; yet am i not hereby justified
but he that judgeth me is the lord
therefore judge nothing before the time, until the lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts
and then shall every man have praise of god
and these things, brethren, i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another
for who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?
now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us
and i would to god ye did reign, that we also might reign with you
for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death
for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men
we are fools for christs sake, but ye are wise in christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised
even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
and labour, working with our own hands
being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it
being defamed, we intreat
we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day
i write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons i warn you
for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ, yet have ye not many fathers
for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel
wherefore i beseech you, be ye followers of me
for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ, as i teach every where in every church
now some are puffed up, as though i would not come to you
but i will come to you shortly, if the lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power
for the kingdom of god is not in word, but in power
what will ye? shall i come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles, that one should have his fathers wife
and ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you
for i verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though i were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,
in the name of our lord jesus christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our lord jesus christ,
to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
your glorying is not good
know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened
for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us
therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world
but now i have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat
for what have i to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
but them that are without god judgeth
therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person
dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church
i speak to your shame
is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers
now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another
why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren
know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god? be not deceived
neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of god
and such were some of you
but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus, and by the spirit of our god
all things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me, but i will not be brought under the power of any
meats for the belly, and the belly for meats
but god shall destroy both it and them
now the body is not for fornication, but for the lord; and the lord for the body
and god hath both raised up the lord, and will also raise up us by his own power
know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ? shall i then take the members of christ, and make them the members of an harlot? god forbid
what? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh
but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit
flee fornication
every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body
what? know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you, which ye have of god, and ye are not your own?
for ye are bought with a price
therefore glorify god in your body, and in your spirit, which are gods
now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me
it is good for a man not to touch a woman
nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband
let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence
and likewise also the wife unto the husband
the wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband
and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife
defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that satan tempt you not for your incontinency
but i speak this by permission, and not of commandment
for i would that all men were even as i myself
but every man hath his proper gift of god, one after this manner, and another after that
i say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they abide even as i
but if they cannot contain, let them marry
for it is better to marry than to burn
and unto the married i command, yet not i, but the lord, let not the wife depart from her husband
but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband
and let not the husband put away his wife
but to the rest speak i, not the lord
if any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away
and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband
else were your children unclean; but now are they holy
but if the unbelieving depart, let him depart
a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases
but god hath called us to peace
for what knowest thou, o wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, o man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
but as god hath distributed to every man, as the lord hath called every one, so let him walk
and so ordain i in all churches
is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised
is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised
circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of god
let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called
art thou called being a servant? care not for it
but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather
for he that is called in the lord, being a servant, is the lords freeman
likewise also he that is called, being free, is christs servant
ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men
brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with god
now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord
yet i give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful
i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, i say, that it is good for a man so to be
art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed
art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife
but and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned
nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh
but i spare you
but this i say, brethren, the time is short
it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
and they that use this world, as not abusing it
for the fashion of this world passeth away
but i would have you without carefulness
he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord, how he may please the lord
but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife
there is difference also between a wife and a virgin
the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit
but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband
and this i speak for your own profit; not that i may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction
but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not
let them marry
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well
so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the lord
but she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment
and i think also that i have the spirit of god
now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge
knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth
and if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know
but if any man love god, the same is known of him
as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other god but one
for though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, 
but to us there is but one god, the father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one lord jesus christ, by whom are all things, and we by him
howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge
for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled
but meat commendeth us not to god
for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse
but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak
for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom christ died?
but when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against christ
wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, i will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest i make my brother to offend
am i not an apostle? am i not free? have i not seen jesus christ our lord? are not ye my work in the lord?
if i be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless i am to you
for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord
mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
have we not power to eat and to drink?
have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the lord, and cephas?
or i only and barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
say i these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
for it is written in the law of moses, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn
doth god take care for oxen?
or saith he it altogether for our sakes? for our sakes, no doubt, this is written
that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope
if we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
if others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of christ
do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter?
even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel
but i have used none of these things
neither have i written these things, that it should be so done unto me
for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void
for though i preach the gospel, i have nothing to glory of
for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if i preach not the gospel!
for if i do this thing willingly, i have a reward
but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me
what is my reward then? verily that, when i preach the gospel, i may make the gospel of christ without charge, that i abuse not my power in the gospel
for though i be free from all men, yet have i made myself servant unto all, that i might gain the more
and unto the jews i became as a jew, that i might gain the jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that i might gain them that are under the law;
to them that are without law, as without law,  that i might gain them that are without law
to the weak became i as weak, that i might gain the weak
i am made all things to all men, that i might by all means save some
and this i do for the gospels sake, that i might be partaker thereof with you
know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? so run, that ye may obtain
and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things
now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible
i therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight i, not as one that beateth the air
but i keep under my body, and bring it into subjection
lest that by any means, when i have preached to others, i myself should be a castaway
moreover, brethren, i would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea;
and did all eat the same spiritual meat;
and did all drink the same spiritual drink
for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them
and that rock was christ
but with many of them god was not well pleased
for they were overthrown in the wilderness
now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted
neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play
neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand
neither let us tempt christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents
neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer
now all these things happened unto them for ensamples
and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come
wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall
there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man
but god is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it
wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry
i speak as to wise men; judge ye what i say
the cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of christ?
for we being many are one bread, and one body
for we are all partakers of that one bread
behold israel after the flesh
are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alter?
what say i then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
but i say, that the things which the gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to god
and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils
ye cannot drink the cup of the lord, and the cup of devils
ye cannot be partakers of the lords table, and of the table of devils
do we provoke the lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
all things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not
let no man seek his own, but every man anothers wealth
whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake
for the earth is the lords, and the fulness thereof
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake
but if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake
for the earth is the lords, and the fulness thereof
conscience, i say, not thine own, but of the other
for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscience?
for if i by grace be a partaker, why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks?
whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of god
give none offence, neither to the jews, nor to the gentiles, nor to the church of god
even as i please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved
be ye followers of me, even as i also am of christ
now i praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as i delivered them to you
but i would have you know, that the head of every man is christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of christ is god
every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head
but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head
for that is even all one as if she were shaven
for if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn
but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god
but the woman is the glory of the man
for the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man
neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man
for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the lord
for as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of god
judge in yourselves
is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered?
doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
but if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her
for her hair is given her for a covering
but if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of god
now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse
for first of all, when ye come together in the church, i hear that there be divisions among you; and i partly believe it
for there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you
when ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the lords supper
for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper
and one is hungry, and another is drunken
what? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of god, and shame them that have not? what shall i say to you? shall i praise you in this? i praise you not
for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you, that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread
and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, take, eat
this is my body, which is broken for you
this do in remembrance of me
after the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood
this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me
for as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the lords death till he come
wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord
but let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the lords body
for this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep
for if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged
but when we are judged, we are chastened of the lord, that we should not be condemned with the world
wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another
and if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation
and the rest will i set in order when i come
now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, i would not have you ignorant
ye know that ye were gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led
wherefore i give you to understand, that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed
and that no man can say that jesus is the lord, but by the holy ghost
now there are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit
and there are differences of administrations, but the same lord
and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same god which worketh all in all
but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal
for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit;
to another faith by the same spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit;
to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues
but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will
for as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body
so also is christ
for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be jews or gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one spirit
for the body is not one member, but many
if the foot shall say, because i am not the hand, i am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
and if the ear shall say, because i am not the eye, i am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
if the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him
and if they were all one member, where were the body?
but now are they many members, yet but one body
and the eye cannot say unto the hand, i have no need of thee
nor again the head to the feet, i have no need of you
nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary
and those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness
for our comely parts have no need
but god hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked
that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another
and whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it
now ye are the body of christ, and members in particular
and god hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues
are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
but covet earnestly the best gifts
and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way
though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, i am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal
and though i have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though i have all faith, so that i could remove mountains, and have not charity, i am nothing
and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though i give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing
charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things
charity never faileth
but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away
for we know in part, and we prophesy in part
but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away
when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child
but when i became a man, i put away childish things
for now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face
now i know in part; but then shall i know even as also i am known
and now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity
follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy
for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto god
for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries
but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort
he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church
i would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied
for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying
now, brethren, if i come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall i profit you, except i shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
and even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
so likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air
there are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification
therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice, i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me
even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church
wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret
for if i pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful
what is it then? i will pray with the spirit, and i will pray with the understanding also
i will sing with the spirit, and i will sing with the understanding also
else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
for thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified
i thank my god, i speak with tongues more than ye all
yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice i might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue
brethren, be not children in understanding
howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men
in the law it is written, with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the lord
wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not
but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe
if therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
but if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship god, and report that god is in you of a truth
how is it then, brethren? when ye come together, everyone of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation
let all things be done unto edifying
if any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret
but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to god
let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge
if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace
for ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted
and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
for god is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints
let your women keep silence in the churches
for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law
and if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home
for it is a shame for women to speak in the church
what? came the word of god out from you? or came it unto you only?
if any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord
but if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant
wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues
let all things be done decently and in order
moreover, brethren, i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain
for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received, how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
and that he was seen of cephas, then of the twelve
after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep
after that, he was seen of james; then of all the apostles
and last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time
for i am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because i persecuted the church of god
but by the grace of god i am what i am
and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but i laboured more abundantly than they all
yet not i, but the grace of god which was with me
therefore whether it were i or they, so we preach, and so ye believed
now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
but if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is christ not risen
and if christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain
yea, and we are found false witnesses of god; because we have testified of god that he raised up christ
whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not
for if the dead rise not, then is not christ raised
and if christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins
then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished
if in this life only we have hope in christ, we are of all men most miserable
but now is christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept
for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead
for as in adam all die, even so in christ shall all be made alive
but every man in his own order
christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are christs at his coming
then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god, even the father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power
for he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet
the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death
for he hath put all things under his feet
but when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him
and when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that god may be all in all
else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
and why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord, i die daily
if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die
be not deceived
evil communications corrupt good manners
awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of god
i speak this to your shame
but some man will say, how are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die
and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain
but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body
all flesh is not the same flesh
but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds
there are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial
but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another
there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars
for one star differeth from another star in glory
so also is the resurrection of the dead
it is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption
it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory
it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power
it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body
there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body
and so it is written, the first man adam was made a living soul; the last adam was made a quickening spirit
howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual
the first man is of the earth, earthy
the second man is the lord from heaven
as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy
and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly
and as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly
now this i say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
behold, i shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump
for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed
for this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality
so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory
o death, where is thy sting? o grave, where is thy victory?
the sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law
but thanks be to god, which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ
therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord
now concerning the collection for the saints, as i have given order to the churches of galatia, even so do ye
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as god hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when i come
and when i come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem
and if it be meet that i go also, they shall go with me
now i will come unto you, when i shall pass through macedonia
for i do pass through macedonia
and it may be that i will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go
for i will not see you now by the way; but i trust to tarry a while with you, if the lord permit
but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost
for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries
now if timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear
for he worketh the work of the lord, as i also do
let no man therefore despise him
but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me
for i look for him with the brethren
as touching our brother apollos, i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren
but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time
watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong
let all your things be done with charity
i beseech you, brethren, 
that ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth
i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus
for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied
for they have refreshed my spirit and yours
therefore acknowledge ye them that are such
the churches of asia salute you
aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord, with the church that is in their house
all the brethren greet you
greet ye one another with an holy kiss
the salutation of me paul with mine own hand
if any man love not the lord jesus christ, let him be anathema maranatha
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
my love be with you all in christ jesus
amen
paul, an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god, and timothy our brother, unto the church of god which is at corinth, with all the saints which are in all achaia
grace be to you and peace from god our father, and from the lord jesus christ
blessed be god, even the father of our lord jesus christ, the father of mercies, and the god of all comfort;
who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god
for as the sufferings of christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by christ
and whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer
or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation
and our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation
for we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in god which raiseth the dead
who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver
in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;
ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf
for our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of god, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward
for we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
as also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus
and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
and to pass by you into macedonia, and to come again out of macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea
when i therefore was thus minded, did i use lightness? or the things that i purpose, do i purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
but as god is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay
for the son of god, jesus christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and silvanus and timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea
for all the promises of god in him are yea, and in him amen, unto the glory of god by us
now he which stablisheth us with you in christ, and hath anointed us, is god;
who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts
moreover i call god for a record upon my soul, that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth
not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy
for by faith ye stand
but i determined this with myself, that i would not come again to you in heaviness
for if i make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
and i wrote this same unto you, lest, when i came, i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you
but if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part
that i may not overcharge you all
sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many
so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow
wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him
for to this end also did i write, that i might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things
to whom ye forgive any thing, i forgive also
for if i forgave any thing, to whom i forgave it, for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ;
lest satan should get an advantage of us
for we are not ignorant of his devices
furthermore, when i came to troas to preach christs gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the lord,
i had no rest in my spirit, because i found not titus my brother
but taking my leave of them, i went from thence into macedonia
now thanks be unto god, which always causeth us to triumph in christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place
for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish
to the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life
and who is sufficient for these things?
for we are not as many, which corrupt the word of god
but as of sincerity, but as of god, in the sight of god speak we in christ
do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men
forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living god; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart
and such trust have we through christ to god-ward
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of god;
who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit
for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life
but if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away
how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
for if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory
for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth
for if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious
seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech
and not as moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished
but their minds were blinded
for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in christ
but even unto this day, when moses is read, the vail is upon their heart
nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord, the vail shall be taken away
now the lord is that spirit
and where the spirit of the lord is, there is liberty
but we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the lord
therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of god deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god
but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ, who is the image of god, should shine unto them
for we preach not ourselves, but christ jesus the lord; and ourselves your servants for jesus sake
for god, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of god, and not of us
we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus, that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body
for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sake, that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
so then death worketh in us, but life in you
we having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, i believed, and therefore have i spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus, and shall present us with you
for all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god
for which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day
for our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen
for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal
for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of god, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens
for in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven
if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened
not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life
now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit
therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the lord

we are confident, i say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the lord
wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad
knowing therefore the terror of the lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto god; and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences
for we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart
for whether we be beside ourselves, it is to god
or whether we be sober, it is for your cause
for the love of christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead
and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again
wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh
yea, though we have known christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more
therefore if any man be in christ, he is a new creature
old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new
and all things are of god, who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
to wit, that god was in christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation
now then we are ambassadors for christ, as though god did beseech you by us
we pray you in christs stead, be ye reconciled to god
for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
we then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain

giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed
but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
by pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the holy ghost, by love unfeigned,
by the word of truth, by the power of god, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
by honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report
as deceivers, and yet true;
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things
o ye corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged
ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels
now for a recompence in the same,  be ye also enlarged
be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers
for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
and what concord hath christ with belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols? for ye are the temple of the living god; as god hath said, i will dwell in them, and walk in them; and i will be their god, and they shall be my people
wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and i will receive you,
and will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the lord almighty
having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of god
receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man
i speak not this to condemn you
for i have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you
great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you
i am filled with comfort, i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation
for, when we were come into macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears
nevertheless god, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of titus;
and not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that i rejoiced the more
for though i made you sorry with a letter, i do not repent, though i did repent
for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season
now i rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance
for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing
for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of
but the sorrow of the world worketh death
for behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter
wherefore, though i wrote unto you, i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you
therefore we were comforted in your comfort
yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all
for if i have boasted any thing to him of you, i am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which i made before titus, is found a truth
and his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him
i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things
moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia;
how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality
for to their power, i bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;
praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints
and this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the lord, and unto us by the will of god
insomuch that we desired titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also
therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also
i speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love
for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich
and herein i give my advice
for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago
now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have
for if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not
for i mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened
but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want
that there may be equality
as it is written, he that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack
but thanks be to god, which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you
for indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you
and we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
and not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord, and declaration of your ready mind
avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us
providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the lord, but also in the sight of men
and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which i have in you
whether any do inquire of titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you
or our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of christ
wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf
for as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you
for i know the forwardness of your mind, for which i boast of you to them of macedonia, that achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many
yet have i sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as i said, ye may be ready
lest haply if they of macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we  should be ashamed in this same confident boasting
therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness
but this i say, he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully
every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity
for god loveth a cheerful giver
and god is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work
(as it is written, he hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor
his righteousness remaineth for ever
now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to god
for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god;
whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;
and by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you
thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift
now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you
but i beseech you, that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence, wherewith i think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh
for though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh

casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ;
and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled
do ye look on things after the outward appearance? if any man trust to himself that he is christs, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is christs, even so are we christs
for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, i should not be ashamed
that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters
for his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible
let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present
for we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves
but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise
but we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you
for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ
not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other mens labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to our hand
but he that glorieth, let him glory in the lord
for not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the lord commendeth
would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly
and indeed bear with me
for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy
for i have espoused you to one husband, that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ
but i fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ
for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him
for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles
but though i be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things
have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely?
i robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service
and when i was present with you, and wanted, i was chargeable to no man
for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied
and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will i keep myself
as the truth of christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia
wherefore? because i love you not? god knoweth
but what i do, that i will do, that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we
for such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of christ
and no marvel; for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works
i say again, let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that i may boast myself a little
that which i speak, i speak it not after the lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting
seeing that many glory after the flesh, i will glory also
for ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise
for ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face
i speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak
howbeit whereinsoever any is bold,  i am bold also
are they hebrews? so am i
are they israelites? so am i
are they the seed of abraham? so am i
are they ministers of christ?  i am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft
of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one
thrice was i beaten with rods, once was i stoned, thrice i suffered shipwreck, a night and a day i have been in the deep;
in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness
beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches
who is weak, and i am not weak? who is offended, and i burn not?
if i must needs glory, i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities
the god and father of our lord jesus christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that i lie not
in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me
and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall, and escaped his hands
it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory
i will come to visions and revelations of the lord
i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago,  such an one caught up to the third heaven
and i knew such a man, 
how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter
of such an one will i glory
yet of myself i will not glory, but in mine infirmities
for though i would desire to glory, i shall not be a fool; for i will say the truth
but now i forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me
and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of satan to buffet me, lest i should be exalted above measure
for this thing i besought the lord thrice, that it might depart from me
and he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee
for my strength is made perfect in weakness
most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of christ may rest upon me
therefore i take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for christs sake
for when i am weak, then am i strong
i am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me
for i ought to have been commended of you
for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles, though i be nothing
truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds
for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong
behold, the third time i am ready to come to you; and i will not be burdensome to you
for i seek not yours, but you
for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children
and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly i love you, the less i be loved
but be it so, i did not burden you
nevertheless, being crafty, i caught you with guile
did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you?
i desired titus, and with him i sent a brother
did titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?
again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before god in christ
but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying
for i fear, lest, when i come, i shall not find you such as i would, and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not
lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults
and lest, when i come again, my god will humble me among you, and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed
this is the third time i am coming to you
in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established
i told you before, and foretell you, as if i were present, the second time; and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if i come again, i will not spare
since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you
for though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of god
for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you
examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves
know ye not your own selves, how that jesus christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates
now i pray to god that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates
for we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth
for we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong
and this also we wish, even your perfection
therefore i write these things being absent, lest being present i should use sharpness, according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction
finally, brethren, farewell
be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the god of love and peace shall be with you
greet one another with an holy kiss
all the saints salute you
the grace of the lord jesus christ, and the love of god, and the communion of the holy ghost, be with you all
amen
paul, an apostle, 
and all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of galatia
grace be to you and peace from god the father, and from our lord jesus christ,
who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of god and our father
to whom be glory for ever and ever
amen
i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel
which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of christ
but though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed
as we said before, so say i now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed
for do i now persuade men, or god? or do i seek to please men? for if i yet pleased men, i should not be the servant of christ
but i certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man
for i neither received it of man, neither was i taught it, but by the revelation of jesus christ
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion, how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god, and wasted it
and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers
but when it pleased god, who separated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace,
to reveal his son in me, that i might preach him among the heathen; immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood
neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but i went into arabia, and returned again unto damascus
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter, and abode with him fifteen days
but other of the apostles saw i none, save james the lords brother
now the things which i write unto you, behold, before god, i lie not
afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia;
and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ
but they had heard only, that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed
and they glorified god in me
then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas, and took titus with me also
and i went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means i should run, or had run, in vain
but neither titus, who was with me, being a greek, was compelled to be circumcised
and that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus, that they might bring us into bondage
to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you
but of these who seemed to be somewhat,  for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me
but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter;

and when james, cephas, and john, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision
only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which i also was forward to do
but when peter was come to antioch, i withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed
for before that certain came from james, he did eat with the gentiles
but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision
and the other jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation
but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, i said unto peter before them all, if thou, being a jew, livest after the manner of gentiles, and not as do the jews, why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews?
we who are jews by nature, and not sinners of the gentiles,
knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of jesus christ, even we have believed in jesus christ, that we might be justified by the faith of christ, and not by the works of the law
for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
but if, while we seek to be justified by christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore christ the minister of sin? god forbid
for if i build again the things which i destroyed, i make myself a transgressor
for i through the law am dead to the law, that i might live unto god
i am crucified with christ
nevertheless i live; yet not i, but christ liveth in me
and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god, who loved me, and gave himself for me
i do not frustrate the grace of god
for if righteousness come by the law, then christ is dead in vain
o foolish galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
this only would i learn of you, received ye the spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
are ye so foolish? having begun in the spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain
he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
even as abraham believed god, and it was accounted to him for righteousness
know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of abraham
and the scripture, foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto abraham, saying, in thee shall all nations be blessed
so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse
for it is written, cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god, it is evident
for, the just shall live by faith
and the law is not of faith
but, the man that doeth them shall live in them
christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us
for it is written, cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree
that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ; that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
brethren, i speak after the manner of men; though it be but a mans covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto
now to abraham and his seed were the promises made
he saith not, and to seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is christ
and this i say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of god in christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect
for if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise
but god gave it to abraham by promise
wherefore then serveth the law? it was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator
now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but god is one
is the law then against the promises of god? god forbid
for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
but before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed
wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ, that we might be justified by faith
but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster
for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ
there is neither jew nor greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female
for ye are all one in christ jesus
and if ye be christs, then are ye abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise
now i say, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father
even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world
but when the fulness of the time was come, god sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law,
to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons
and because ye are sons, god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, abba, father
wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of god through christ
howbeit then, when ye knew not god, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods
but now, after that ye have known god, or rather are known of god, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
ye observe days, and months, and times, and years
i am afraid of you, lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain
brethren, i beseech you, be as i am; for i am as ye are
ye have not injured me at all
ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first
and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of god, even as christ jesus
where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for i bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me
am i therefore become your enemy, because i tell you the truth?
they zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them
but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when i am present with you
my little children, of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you,
i desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for i stand in doubt of you
tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
for it is written, that abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman
but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise
which things are an allegory
for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is agar
for this agar is mount sinai in arabia, and answereth to jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children
but jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all
for it is written, rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not
for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband
now we, brethren, as isaac was, are the children of promise
but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so it is now
nevertheless what saith the scripture? cast out the bondwoman and her son
for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman
so then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
behold, i paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, christ shall profit you nothing
for i testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law
christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace
for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith
for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love
ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
i have confidence in you through the lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded
but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be
and i, brethren, if i yet preach circumcision, why do i yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased
i would they were even cut off which trouble you
for, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another
for all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
but if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another
this i say then, walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulful the lust of the flesh
for the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh
and these are contrary the one to the other
so that ye cannot do the things that ye would
but if ye be led of the spirit, ye are not under the law
now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like
of the which i tell you before, as i have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god
but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance
against such there is no law
and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
if we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit
let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another
brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted
bear ye one anothers burdens, and so fulfil the law of christ
for if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself
but let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another
for every man shall bear his own burden
let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things
be not deceived; god is not mocked
for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap
for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting
and let us not be weary in well doing
for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not
as we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith
ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand
as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh
but god forbid that i should glory, save in the cross of our lord jesus christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and i unto the world
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature
and as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the israel of god
from henceforth let no man trouble me
for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus
brethren, the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit
amen
paul, an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god, to the saints which are at ephesus, and to the faithful in christ jesus
grace be to you, and peace, from god our father, and from the lord jesus christ
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself
that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in christ
in whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation
in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise,
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory
wherefore i also, after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus, and love unto all the saints,
cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
that the god of our lord jesus christ, the father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
which he wrought in christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come
and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,
which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all
and you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others
but god, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with christ, 
and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus
for by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves
it is the gift of god
not of works, lest any man should boast
for we are his workmanship, created in christ jesus unto good works, which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them
wherefore remember, that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
that at that time ye were without christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without god in the world
but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ
for he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;
and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby
and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh
for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father
now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of god;
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone;
in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord
in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit
for this cause i paul, the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles,
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward
how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as i wrote afore in few words,
whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ)
which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit;
that the gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel
whereof i was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power
unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ;
and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god, who created all things by jesus christ
to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god,
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him
wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory
for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ,
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man;
that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
and to know the love of christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god
now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages, world without end
amen
i therefore, the prisoner of the lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
there is one body, and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
one lord, one faith, one baptism,
one god and father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all
but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ
wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men
(now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things
)
and he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of christ
till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the son of god, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ
that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even christ
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love
this i say therefore, and testify in the lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart
who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness
but ye have not so learned christ;
if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in jesus
that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
and that ye put on the new man, which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness
wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour
for we are members one of another
be ye angry, and sin not
let not the sun go down upon your wrath
neither give place to the devil
let him that stole steal no more
but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers
and grieve not the holy spirit of god, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice
and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you
be ye therefore followers of god, as dear children;
and walk in love, as christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour
but fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient
but rather giving of thanks
for this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
let no man deceive you with vain words
for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience
be not ye therefore partakers with them
for ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the lord
walk as children of light

proving what is acceptable unto the lord
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them
for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret
but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light
for whatsoever doth make manifest is light
wherefore he saith, awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and christ shall give thee light
see then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
redeeming the time, because the days are evil
wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the lord is
and be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the spirit;
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the lord;
giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ;
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god
wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the lord
for the husband is the head of the wife, even as christ is the head of the church
and he is the saviour of the body
therefore as the church is subject unto christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing
husbands, love your wives, even as christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish
so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies
he that loveth his wife loveth himself
for no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the lord the church
for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh
this is a great mystery
but i speak concerning christ and the church
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband
children, obey your parents in the lord
for this is right
honour thy father and mother; 
that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth
and, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath
but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord
servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto christ;
not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of christ, doing the will of god from the heart;
with good will doing service, as to the lord, and not to men
knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the lord, whether he be bond or free
and, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening
knowing that your master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him
finally, my brethren, be strong in the lord, and in the power of his might
put on the whole armour of god, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places
wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand
stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of god
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that i may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
for which i am an ambassador in bonds
that therein i may speak boldly, as i ought to speak
but that ye also may know my affairs, and how i do, tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord, shall make known to you all things
whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts
peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from god the father and the lord jesus christ
grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity
amen
paul, an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god, and timotheus our brother,
to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colosse
grace be unto you, and peace, from god our father and the lord jesus christ
we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ, praying always for you,
since we heard of your faith in christ jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of god in truth
as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of christ;
who also declared unto us your love in the spirit
for this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of god;
strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
giving thanks unto the father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins
who is the image of the invisible god, the firstborn of every creature
for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers
all things were created by him, and for him
and he is before all things, and by him all things consist
and he is the head of the body, the church
who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence
for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell;
and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, i say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven
and you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight
if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof i paul am made a minister;
who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake, which is the church
whereof i am made a minister, according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of god;
even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints
to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles; which is christ in you, the hope of glory
whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus
whereunto i also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily
for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you, and for them at laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god, and of the father, and of christ;
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
and this i say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words
for though i be absent in the flesh, yet am i with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in christ
as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord, so walk ye in him
rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving
beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after christ
for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily
and ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power
in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ
buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god, who hath raised him from the dead
and you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it
let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days
which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of christ
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
and not holding the head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of god
wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
(touch not; taste not; handle not;
which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh
if ye then be risen with christ, seek those things which are above, where christ sitteth on the right hand of god
set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth
for ye are dead, and your life is hid with christ in god
when christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory
mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry
for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience
in the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them
but now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth
lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
where there is neither greek nor jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, scythian, bond nor free
but christ is all, and in all
put on therefore, as the elect of god, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any
even as christ forgave you, so also do ye
and above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness
and let the peace of god rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful
let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
and whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the lord jesus, giving thanks to god and the father by him
wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the lord
husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them
children, obey your parents in all things
for this is well pleasing unto the lord
fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged
servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing god
and whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the lord, and not unto men;
knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance
for ye serve the lord christ
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done
and there is no respect of persons
masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a master in heaven
continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
withal praying also for us, that god would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of christ, for which i am also in bonds
that i may make it manifest, as i ought to speak
walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time
let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man
all my state shall tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord
whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;
with onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you
they shall make known unto you all things which are done here
aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and marcus, sisters son to barnabas, 
and jesus, which is called justus, who are of the circumcision
these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god, which have been a comfort unto me
epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god
for i bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in laodicea, and them in hierapolis
luke, the beloved physician, and demas, greet you
salute the brethren which are in laodicea, and nymphas, and the church which is in his house
and when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from laodicea
and say to archippus, take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord, that thou fulfil it
the salutation by the hand of me paul
remember my bonds
grace be with you
amen
paul, and silvanus, and timotheus, unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ
grace be unto you, and peace, from god our father, and the lord jesus christ
we give thanks to god always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ, in the sight of god and our father;
knowing, brethren beloved, your election of god
for our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake
and ye became followers of us, and of the lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the holy ghost
so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia
for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia, but also in every place your faith to god-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing
for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god;
and to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come
for yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain
but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at philippi, we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention
for our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile
but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but god, which trieth our hearts
for neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; god is witness
nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of christ
but we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children
so being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of god only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us
for ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail
for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of god
ye are witnesses, and god also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe
as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,
that ye would walk worthy of god, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
for this cause also thank we god without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of god, which effectually worketh also in you that believe
for ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus
for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the jews
who both killed the lord jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not god, and are contrary to all men
forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway
for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost
but we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire
wherefore we would have come unto you, even i paul, once and again; but satan hindered us
for what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming?
for ye are our glory and joy
wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at athens alone;
and sent timotheus, our brother, and minister of god, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith
that no man should be moved by these afflictions
for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto
for verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know
for this cause, when i could no longer forbear, i sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain
but now when timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you
therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith
for now we live, if ye stand fast in the lord
for what thanks can we render to god again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god;
night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
now god himself and our father, and our lord jesus christ, direct our way unto you
and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you
to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god, even our father, at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints
furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the lord jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god, so ye would abound more and more
for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus
for this is the will of god, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the gentiles which know not god
that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter
because that the lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified
for god hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness
he therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but god, who hath also given unto us his holy spirit
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you
for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia
but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing
but i would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him
for this we say unto you by the word of the lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep
for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of god
and the dead in christ shall rise first
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the lord in the air
and so shall we ever be with the lord
wherefore comfort one another with these words
but of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that i write unto you
for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night
for when they shall say, peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape
but ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief
ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day
we are not of the night, nor of darkness
therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober
for they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night
but let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation
for god hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ,
who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him
wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do
and we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the lord, and admonish you;
and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake
and be at peace among yourselves
now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men
see that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men
rejoice evermore
pray without ceasing
in every thing give thanks
for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you
quench not the spirit
despise not prophesyings
prove all things; hold fast that which is good
abstain from all appearance of evil
and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly; and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it
brethren, pray for us
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss
i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
amen
paul, and silvanus, and timotheus, unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
grace unto you, and peace, from god our father and the lord jesus christ
we are bound to thank god always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god, for which ye also suffer
seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
and to you who are troubled rest with us, when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god, and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord, and from the glory of his power;
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe  in that day
wherefore also we pray always for you, that our god would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power
that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our lord jesus christ, and by our gathering together unto him,
that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of christ is at hand
let no man deceive you by any means
for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god, or that is worshipped; so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god, shewing himself that he is god
remember ye not, that, when i was yet with you, i told you these things?
and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time
for the mystery of iniquity doth already work
only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way
and then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming
even him, whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved
and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness
but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you, brethren beloved of the lord, because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth
whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ
therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle
now our lord jesus christ himself, and god, even our father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work
finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men
for all men have not faith
but the lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil
and we have confidence in the lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you
and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god, and into the patient waiting for christ
now we command you, brethren, in the name of our lord jesus christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us
for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us
for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
neither did we eat any mans bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you
not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us
for even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat
for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies
now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing
and if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed
yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother
now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means
the lord be with you all
the salutation of paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle
so i write
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all
amen
paul, an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour, and lord jesus christ, which is our hope;
unto timothy, my own son in the faith
grace, mercy, and peace, from god our father and jesus christ our lord
as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus, when i went into macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith
so do
now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned
from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm
but we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god, which was committed to my trust
and i thank christ jesus our lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious
but i obtained mercy, because i did it ignorantly in unbelief
and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus
this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom i am chief
howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy, that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting
now unto the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise god, be honour and glory for ever and ever
amen
this charge i commit unto thee, son timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck
of whom is hymenaeus and alexander; whom i have delivered unto satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme
i exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty
for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour;
who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth
for there is one god, and one mediator between god and men, the man christ jesus;
who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time
whereunto i am ordained a preacher, and an apostle,  a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity
i will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting
in like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
but  with good works
let the woman learn in silence with all subjection
but i suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence
for adam was first formed, then eve
and adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression
notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety
this is a true saying, if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work
a bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;

not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil
moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil
likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience
and let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless
even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things
let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well
for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus
these things write i unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly
but if i tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god, which is the church of the living god, the pillar and ground of the truth
and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness
god was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory
now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth
for every creature of god is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving
for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained
but refuse profane and old wives fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness
for bodily exercise profiteth little
but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation
for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living god, who is the saviour of all men, specially of those that believe
these things command and teach
let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity
till i come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine
neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery
meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all
take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them
for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee
rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity
honour widows that are widows indeed
but if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents
for that is good and acceptable before god
now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in god, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day
but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth
and these things give in charge, that they may be blameless
but if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel
let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work
but the younger widows refuse
for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ, they will marry;
having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith
and withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not
i will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully
for some are already turned aside after satan
if any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed
let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine
for the scripture saith, thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn
and, the labourer is worthy of his reward
against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses
them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear
i charge thee before god, and the lord jesus christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality
lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens sins
keep thyself pure
drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities
some mens sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after
likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid
let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed
and they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit
these things teach and exhort
if any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our lord jesus christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness
from such withdraw thyself
but godliness with contentment is great gain
for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out
and having food and raiment let us be therewith content
but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition
for the love of money is the root of all evil
which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
but thou, o man of god, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness
fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses
i give thee charge in the sight of god, who quickeneth all things, and before christ jesus, who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession;
that thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our lord jesus christ
which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only potentate, the king of kings, and lord of lords;
who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see
to whom be honour and power everlasting
amen
charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living god, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life
o timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called
which some professing have erred concerning the faith
grace be with thee
amen
paul, an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god, according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus,
to timothy, my dearly beloved son
grace, mercy, and peace, from god the father and christ jesus our lord
i thank god, whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that i may be filled with joy;
when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois, and thy mother eunice; and i am persuaded that in thee also
wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands
for god hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind
be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord, nor of me his prisoner
but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god;
who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in christ jesus before the world began,
but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
whereunto i am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles
for the which cause i also suffer these things
nevertheless i am not ashamed
for i know whom i have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day
hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in christ jesus
that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us
this thou knowest, that all they which are in asia be turned away from me; of whom are phygellus and hermogenes
the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain
but, when he was in rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me
the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day
and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus, thou knowest very well
thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also
thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of jesus christ
no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier
and if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully
the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits
consider what i say; and the lord give thee understanding in all things
remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel
wherein i suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of god is not bound
therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory
it is a faithful saying
for if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him
if we suffer, we shall also reign with him
if we deny him, he also will deny us
if we believe not, yet he abideth faithful
he cannot deny himself
of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers
study to shew thyself approved unto god, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth
but shun profane and vain babblings
for they will increase unto more ungodliness
and their word will eat as doth a canker
of whom is hymenaeus and philetus;
who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some
nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure, having this seal, the lord knoweth them that are his
and, let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity
but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour
if a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the masters use, and prepared unto every good work
flee also youthful lusts
but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart
but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes
and the servant of the lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,
in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will
this know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come
for men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god;
having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof
from such turn away
for of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
now as jannes and jambres withstood moses, so do these also resist the truth
men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith
but they shall proceed no further
for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was
but thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at antioch, at iconium, at lystra; what persecutions i endured
but out of them all the lord delivered me
yea, and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived
but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus
all scripture is given by inspiration of god, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness
that the man of god may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works
i charge thee therefore before god, and the lord jesus christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine
for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables
but watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry
for i am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand
i have fought a good fight, i have finished my course, i have kept the faith
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day
and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing
do thy diligence to come shortly unto me
for demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto thessalonica; crescens to galatia, titus unto dalmatia
only luke is with me
take mark, and bring him with thee
for he is profitable to me for the ministry
and tychicus have i sent to ephesus
the cloke that i left at troas with carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments
alexander the coppersmith did me much evil
the lord reward him according to his works
of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words
at my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me
i pray god that it may not be laid to their charge
notwithstanding the lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the gentiles might hear
and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion
and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom
to whom be glory for ever and ever
amen

eubulus greeteth thee, and pudens, and linus, and claudia, and all the brethren

amen
paul, a servant of god, and an apostle of jesus christ, according to the faith of gods elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
in hope of eternal life, which god, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our saviour;
to titus, mine own son after the common faith
grace, mercy, and peace, from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour
for this cause left i thee in crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as i had appointed thee
if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly
for a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of god; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers
for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision
whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucres sake
one of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies
this witness is true
wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
not giving heed to jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth
unto the pure all things are pure
but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled
they profess that they know god; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate
but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine
that the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience
the aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of god be not blasphemed
young men likewise exhort to be sober minded
in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works
in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you
exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things
for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ;
who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works
these things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority
let no man despise thee
put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men
for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another
but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared,
not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy ghost;
which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour;
that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
this is a faithful saying, and these things i will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works
these things are good and profitable unto men
but avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain
a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself
when i shall send artemas unto thee, or tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis
for i have determined there to winter
bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them
and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful
all that are with me salute thee
greet them that love us in the faith
grace be with you all
amen
paul, a prisoner of jesus christ, and timothy our brother, unto philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
and to our beloved apphia, and archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house
grace to you, and peace, from god our father and the lord jesus christ
i thank my god, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the lord jesus, and toward all saints;
that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus
for we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother
wherefore, though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
yet for loves sake i rather beseech thee, being such an one as paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of jesus christ
i beseech thee for my son onesimus, whom i have begotten in my bonds
which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me
whom i have sent again
thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels
whom i would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel
but without thy mind would i do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly
for perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the lord?
if thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself
if he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
i paul have written it with mine own hand, i will repay it
albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides
yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the lord
refresh my bowels in the lord
having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say
but withal prepare me also a lodging
for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you
there salute thee epaphras, my fellowprisoner in christ jesus;
marcus, aristarchus, demas, lucas, my fellowlabourers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit
amen
god, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high;
being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they
for unto which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my son, this day have i begotten thee? and again, i will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son?
and again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, and let all the angels of god worship him
and of the angels he saith, who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire
but unto the son he saith, thy throne, o god, is for ever and ever
a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom
thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore god, even thy god, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
and, thou, lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands
they shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed
but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail
but to which of the angels said he at any time, sit on my right hand, until i make thine enemies thy footstool?
are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip
for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;
god also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the holy ghost, according to his own will?
for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak
but one in a certain place testified, saying, what is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet
for in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him
but now we see not yet all things put under him
but we see jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man
for it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings
for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one
for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
saying, i will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee
and again, i will put my trust in him
and again, behold i and the children which god hath given me
forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage
for verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of abraham
wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted
wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our profession, christ jesus;
who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also moses was faithful in all his house
for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house
for every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is god
and moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
but christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
wherefore (as the holy ghost saith, to day if ye will hear his voice,
harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness
when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years
wherefore i was grieved with that generation, and said, they do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways
so i sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest
)
take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living god
but exhort one another daily, while it is called to day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
for we are made partakers of christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
while it is said, to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation
for some, when they had heard, did provoke
howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses
but with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief
let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it
for unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them
but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it
for we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, as i have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest
although the works were finished from the foundation of the world
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, and god did rest the seventh day from all his works
and in this place again, if they shall enter into my rest
seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief
again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in david, to day, after so long a time; as it is said, to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts
for if jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day
there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god
for he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as god did from his
let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief
for the word of god is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight
but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do
seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, jesus the son of god, let us hold fast our profession
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity
and by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins
and no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of god, as was aaron
so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, thou art my son, to day have i begotten thee
as he saith also in another place, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec
of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat
for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness
for he is a babe
but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil
therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward god,
of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment
and this will we do, if god permit
for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy ghost,
and have tasted the good word of god, and the powers of the world to come,
if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh, and put him to an open shame
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from god
but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned
but, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak
for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister
and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end
that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises
for when god made promise to abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
saying, surely blessing i will bless thee, and multiplying i will multiply thee
and so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise
for men verily swear by the greater
and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife
wherein god, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath
that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for god to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
whither the forerunner is for us entered, even jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
for this melchisedec, king of salem, priest of the most high god, who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of salem, which is, king of peace;
without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the son of god; abideth a priest continually
now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils
and verily they that are of the sons of levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of abraham
but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham, and blessed him that had the promises
and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better
and here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth
and as i may so say, levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in abraham
for he was yet in the loins of his father, when melchisedec met him
if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood,  what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec, and not be called after the order of aaron?
for the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law
for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar
for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda; of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood
and it is yet far more evident
for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life
for he testifieth, thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof
for the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto god
and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest

by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament
and they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death
but this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood
wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them
for such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the peoples
for this he did once, when he offered up himself
for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the son, who is consecrated for evermore
now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum
we have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens;
a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the lord pitched, and not man
for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices
wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer
for if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle
for, see, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises
for if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second
for finding fault with them, he saith, behold, the days come, saith the lord, when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and i regarded them not, saith the lord
for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days, saith the lord; i will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts
and i will be to them a god, and they shall be to me a people
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, know the lord
for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest
for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more
in that he saith, a new covenant, he hath made the first old
now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away
then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary
for there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary
and after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all;
which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and aarons rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly
now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of god
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people
the holy ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing
which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation
but christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us
for if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh
how much more shall the blood of christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god?
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance
for where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator
for a testament is of force after men are dead
otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth
whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood
for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
saying, this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you
moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry
and almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission
it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these
for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of god for us
nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world
but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself
and as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment
so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation
for the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect
for then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins
wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me
in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure
then said i, lo, i come  to do thy will, o god
above when he said, sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;
then said he, lo, i come to do thy will, o god
he taketh away the first, that he may establish the second
by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all
and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins
but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of god;
from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool
for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified
whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us
for after that he had said before,
this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days, saith the lord, i will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will i write them;
and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more
now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin
having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus,
by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
and having an high priest over the house of god;
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water
let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; 
and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another
and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching
for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries
he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses
of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the son of god, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace?
for we know him that hath said, vengeance belongeth unto me, i will recompense, saith the lord
and again, the lord shall judge his people
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
but call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance
cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward
for ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of god, ye might receive the promise
for yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry
now the just shall live by faith
but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen
for by it the elders obtained a good report
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear
by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, god testifying of his gifts
and by it he being dead yet speaketh
by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because god had translated him
for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased god
but without faith it is impossible to please him
for he that cometh to god must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him
by faith noah, being warned of god of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith
by faith abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise
for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is god
through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised
therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable
these all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country
and truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned
but now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly
wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god
for he hath prepared for them a city
by faith abraham, when he was tried, offered up isaac
and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
of whom it was said, that in isaac shall thy seed be called
accounting that god was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure
by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come
by faith jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff
by faith joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones
by faith moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the kings commandment
by faith moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter;
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt
for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward
by faith he forsook egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king
for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible
through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them
by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land
which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned
by faith the walls of jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days
by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace
and what shall i more say? for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon, and of barak, and of samson, and of jephthae; of david also, and samuel, and of the prophets
who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens
women received their dead raised to life again
and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment
they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword
they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
 they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth
and these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise
god having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect
wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god
for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds
ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, my son, despise not thou the chastening of the lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
if ye endure chastening, god dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
but if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence
shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits, and live?
for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness
now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous
nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby
wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed
follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the lord
looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;
lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright
for ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected
for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears
for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more
(for they could not endure that which was commanded, and if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart
and so terrible was the sight, that moses said, i exceedingly fear and quake
)
but ye are come unto mount sion, and unto the city of the living god, the heavenly jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to god the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of abel
see that ye refuse not him that speaketh
for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven
whose voice then shook the earth
but now he hath promised, saying, yet once more i shake not the earth only, but also heaven
and this word, yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain
wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear
for our god is a consuming fire
let brotherly love continue
be not forgetful to entertain strangers
for thereby some have entertained angels unawares
remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body
marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled
but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge
let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have
for he hath said, i will never leave thee, nor forsake thee
so that we may boldly say, the lord is my helper, and i will not fear what man shall do unto me
remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of god
whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation
jesus christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines
for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein
we have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle
for the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp
wherefore jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate
let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach
for here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name
but to do good and to communicate forget not
for with such sacrifices god is well pleased
obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves
for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief
for that is unprofitable for you
pray for us
for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly
but i beseech you the rather to do this, that i may be restored to you the sooner
now the god of peace, that brought again from the dead our lord jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through jesus christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever
amen
and i beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation
for i have written a letter unto you in few words
know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, i will see you
salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints
they of italy salute you
grace be with you all
amen
james, a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting
my brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience
but let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing
if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of god, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him
but let him ask in faith, nothing wavering
for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed
for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord
a double minded man is unstable in all his ways
let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
but the rich, in that he is made low
because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away
for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth
so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways
blessed is the man that endureth temptation
for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the lord hath promised to them that love him
let no man say when he is tempted, i am tempted of god
for god cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man
but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed
then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin
and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death
do not err, my beloved brethren
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning
of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god
wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls
but be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves
for if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass
for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed
if any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans religion is vain
pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world
my brethren, have not the faith of our lord jesus christ, the lord of glory, with respect of persons
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool
are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
hearken, my beloved brethren, hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
but ye have despised the poor
do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well
but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors
for whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all
for he that said, do not commit adultery, said also, do not kill
now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law
so speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty
for he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment
what doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
if a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
and one of you say unto them, depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone
yea, a man may say, thou hast faith, and i have works
shew me thy faith without thy works, and i will shew thee my faith by my works
thou believest that there is one god; thou doest well
the devils also believe, and tremble
but wilt thou know, o vain man, that faith without works is dead?
was not abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar?
seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, abraham believed god, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness
and he was called the friend of god
ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only
likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?
for as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also
my brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation
for in many things we offend all
if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body
behold, we put bits in the horses mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body
behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth
even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things
behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
and the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity
so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell
for every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind
but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison
therewith bless we god, even the father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of god
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing
my brethren, these things ought not so to be
doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom
but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth
this wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish
for where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace
from whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
ye lust, and have not
ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain
ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not
ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts
ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god
do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
but he giveth more grace
wherefore he saith, god resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble
submit yourselves therefore to god
resist the devil, and he will flee from you
draw nigh to god, and he will draw nigh to you
cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded
be afflicted, and mourn, and weep
let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord, and he shall lift you up
speak not evil one of another, brethren
he that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law
but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge
there is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy
who art thou that judgest another?
go to now, ye that say, to day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow
for what is your life? it is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away
for that ye ought to say, if the lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that
but now ye rejoice in your boastings
all such rejoicing is evil
therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin
go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you
your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten
your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire
ye have heaped treasure together for the last days
behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth
and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth
ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter
ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you
be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the lord
behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain
be ye also patient; stablish your hearts
for the coming of the lord draweth nigh
grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned
behold, the judge standeth before the door
take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience
behold, we count them happy which endure
ye have heard of the patience of job, and have seen the end of the lord; that the lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy
but above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath
but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation
is any among you afflicted? let him pray
is any merry? let him sing psalms
is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the lord
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him
confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain
and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months
and he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit
brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins
peter, an apostle of jesus christ, to the strangers scattered throughout pontus, galatia, cappadocia, asia, and bithynia,
elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father, through sanctification of the spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ
grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead,
to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations
that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ
whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory
receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls
of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you
searching what, or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ, and the glory that should follow
unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into
wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ;
as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance
but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
because it is written, be ye holy; for i am holy
and if ye call on the father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every mans work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear
forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;
but with the precious blood of christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,
who by him do believe in god, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in god
seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently
being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of god, which liveth and abideth for ever
for all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass
the grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away
but the word of the lord endureth for ever
and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you
wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby
if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious
to whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of god, and precious,
ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to god by jesus christ
wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, behold, i lay in sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious
and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded
unto you therefore which believe he is precious
but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient
whereunto also they were appointed
but ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of god
which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy
dearly beloved, i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
having your conversation honest among the gentiles
that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify god in the day of visitation
submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake
whether it be to the king, as supreme;
or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well
for so is the will of god, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
as free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of god
honour all men
love the brotherhood
fear god
honour the king
servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward
for this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward god endure grief, suffering wrongfully
for what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with god
for even hereunto were ye called
because christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps
who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth
who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously
who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness
by whose stripes ye were healed
for ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls
likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;
while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear
whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of god of great price
for after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in god, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands
even as sara obeyed abraham, calling him lord
whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement
likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered
finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous
not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing
but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing
for he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile
let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it
for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers
but the face of the lord is against them that do evil
and who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?
but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye
and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
but sanctify the lord god in your hearts
and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ
for it is better, if the will of god be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing
for christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to god, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the spirit
by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water
the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us  by the resurrection of jesus christ
who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of god; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind
for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of god
for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to god in the spirit
but the end of all things is at hand
be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves
for charity shall cover the multitude of sins
use hospitality one to another without grudging
as every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of god
if any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of god; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which god giveth
that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever
amen
beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you
but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy
if ye be reproached for the name of christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you
on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified
but let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other mens matters
yet if any man suffer as a christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify god on this behalf
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god
and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god?
and if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful creator
the elders which are among you i exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed
feed the flock of god which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
neither as being lords over gods heritage, but being ensamples to the flock
and when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away
likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder
yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility
for god resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god, that he may exalt you in due time
casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you
be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour
whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
but the god of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you
to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever
amen
by silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as i suppose, i have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand
the church that is at babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth marcus my son
greet ye one another with a kiss of charity
peace be with you all that are in christ jesus
amen
simon peter, a servant and an apostle of jesus christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ
grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god, and of jesus our lord,
according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue
whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises
that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust
and beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity
for if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
but he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure
for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall
for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth
yea, i think it meet, as long as i am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle, even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me
moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty
for he received from god the father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased
and this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount
we have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts
knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man
but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost
but there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction
and many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you
whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not
for if god spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
and spared not the old world, but saved noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;
and delivered just lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked

the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government
presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities
whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the lord
but these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time
spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls
an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children
which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of balaam the son of bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
but was rebuked for his iniquity
the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet
these are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error
while they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption
for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them
but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, the dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire
this second epistle, beloved, i now write unto you; in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance
that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour
knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
and saying, where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation
for this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of god the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water
whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished
but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
but, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day
the lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance
but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness
wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless
and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction
ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness
but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ
to him be glory both now and for ever
amen
that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life;

that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us
and truly our fellowship is with the father, and with his son jesus christ
and these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full
this then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that god is light, and in him is no darkness at all
if we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth
but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us
if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
if we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us
my little children, these things write i unto you, that ye sin not
and if any man sin, we have an advocate with the father, jesus christ the righteous
and he is the propitiation for our sins
and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world
and hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments
he that saith, i know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him
but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of god perfected
hereby know we that we are in him
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked
brethren, i write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning
the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning
again, a new commandment i write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you
because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth
he that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes
i write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake
i write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning
i write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one
i write unto you, little children, because ye have known the father
i have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning
i have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of god abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one
love not the world, neither the things that are in the world
if any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him
for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the world
and the world passeth away, and the lust thereof
but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
little children, it is the last time
and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time
they went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us
but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
but ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things
i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth
who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ? he is antichrist, that denieth the father and the son
whosoever denieth the son, the same hath not the father
he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also
let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning
if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the son, and in the father
and this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life
these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you
but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you
but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him
and now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming
if ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him
behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of god
therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not
beloved, now are we the sons of god, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be
but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is
and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure
whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law
for sin is the transgression of the law
and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin
whosoever abideth in him sinneth not
whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him
little children, let no man deceive you
he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous
he that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning
for this purpose the son of god was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil
whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him
and he cannot sin, because he is born of god
in this the children of god are manifest, and the children of the devil
whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god, neither he that loveth not his brother
for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another
not as cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother
and wherefore slew he him? because his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous
marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you
we know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren
he that loveth not his brother abideth in death
whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer
and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him
hereby perceive we the love of god, because he laid down his life for us
and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren
but whoso hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of god in him?
my little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth
and hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him
for if our heart condemn us, god is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things
beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward god
and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
and this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment
and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him
and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spirit which he hath given us
beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of god
because many false prophets are gone out into the world
hereby know ye the spirit of god
every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god
and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world
ye are of god, little children, and have overcome them
because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world
they are of the world
therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them
we are of god
he that knoweth god heareth us; he that is not of god heareth not us
hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error
beloved, let us love one another
for love is of god; and every one that loveth is born of god, and knoweth god
he that loveth not knoweth not god; for god is love
in this was manifested the love of god toward us, because that god sent his only begotten son into the world, that we might live through him
herein is love, not that we loved god, but that he loved us, and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
beloved, if god so loved us, we ought also to love one another
no man hath seen god at any time
if we love one another, god dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us
hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his spirit
and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god, god dwelleth in him, and he in god
and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us
god is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god, and god in him
herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment
because as he is, so are we in this world
there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear
because fear hath torment
he that feareth is not made perfect in love
we love him, because he first loved us
if a man say, i love god, and hateth his brother, he is a liar
for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love god whom he hath not seen?
and this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth god love his brother also
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god
and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him
by this we know that we love the children of god, when we love god, and keep his commandments
for this is the love of god, that we keep his commandments
and his commandments are not grievous
for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world
and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith
who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god?
this is he that came by water and blood, even jesus christ; not by water only, but by water and blood
and it is the spirit that beareth witness, because the spirit is truth
for there are three that bear record in heaven, the father, the word, and the holy ghost
and these three are one
and there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood
and these three agree in one
if we receive the witness of men, the witness of god is greater
for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son
he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself
he that believeth not god hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son
and this is the record, that god hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his son
he that hath the son hath life; and he that hath not the son of god hath not life
these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god
and this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us
and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him
if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death
there is a sin unto death
i do not say that he shall pray for it
all unrighteousness is sin
and there is a sin not unto death
we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not; but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not
and we know that we are of god, and the whole world lieth in wickedness
and we know that the son of god is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his son jesus christ
this is the true god, and eternal life
little children, keep yourselves from idols
amen
the elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom i love in the truth; and not i only, but also all they that have known the truth;
for the truths sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever
grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from god the father, and from the lord jesus christ, the son of the father, in truth and love
i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the father
and now i beseech thee, lady, not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another
and this is love, that we walk after his commandments
this is the commandment, that, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it
for many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh
this is a deceiver and an antichrist
look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward
whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of christ, hath not god
he that abideth in the doctrine of christ, he hath both the father and the son
if there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him god speed
for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds
having many things to write unto you, i would not write with paper and ink
but i trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full
the children of thy elect sister greet thee
amen
the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius, whom i love in the truth
beloved, i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth
for i rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth
i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth
beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church
whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well
because that for his names sake they went forth, taking nothing of the gentiles
we therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth
i wrote unto the church
but diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not
wherefore, if i come, i will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words
and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church
beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good
he that doeth good is of god
but he that doeth evil hath not seen god
demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself
yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true
i had many things to write, but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee
but i trust i shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face
peace be to thee
our friends salute thee
greet the friends by name
jude, the servant of jesus christ, and brother of james, to them that are sanctified by god the father, and preserved in jesus christ, and called
mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied
beloved, when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints
for there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness, and denying the only lord god, and our lord jesus christ
i will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the lord, having saved the people out of the land of egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not
and the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
even as sodom and gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire
likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities
yet michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, the lord rebuke thee
but these speak evil of those things which they know not
but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves
woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of cain, and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of core
these are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear
clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever
and enoch also, the seventh from adam, prophesied of these, saying, behold, the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
these are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having mens persons in admiration because of advantage
but, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ;
how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts
these be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the spirit
but ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the holy ghost,
keep yourselves in the love of god, looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life
and of some have compassion, making a difference
and others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh
now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
to the only wise god our saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever
amen
the revelation of jesus christ, which god gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john
who bare record of the word of god, and of the testimony of jesus christ, and of all things that he saw
blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein
for the time is at hand
john to the seven churches which are in asia
grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven spirits which are before his throne;
and from jesus christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth
unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever
amen
behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him
and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him
even so, amen
i am alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the almighty
i john, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ, was in the isle that is called patmos, for the word of god, and for the testimony of jesus christ
i was in the spirit on the lords day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
saying, i am alpha and omega, the first and the last
and, what thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia; unto ephesus, and unto smyrna, and unto pergamos, and unto thyatira, and unto sardis, and unto philadelphia, and unto laodicea
and i turned to see the voice that spake with me
and being turned, i saw seven golden candlesticks;
and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle
his head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters
and he had in his right hand seven stars
and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword
and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength
and when i saw him, i fell at his feet as dead
and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not; i am the first and the last
i am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, i am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death
write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks
the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches
and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches
unto the angel of the church of ephesus write; these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
i know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil
and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars
and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my names sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted
nevertheless i have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love
remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else i will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent
but this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans, which i also hate
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of god
and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write; these things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
i know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty,  and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of satan
fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer
behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days
be thou faithful unto death, and i will give thee a crown of life
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches; he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death
and to the angel of the church in pergamos write; these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;
i know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where satans seat is
and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where satan dwelleth
but i have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam, who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication
so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans, which thing i hate
repent; or else i will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it
and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write; these things saith the son of god, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;
i know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first
notwithstanding i have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
and i gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not
behold, i will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds
and i will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts
and i will give unto every one of you according to your works
but unto you i say, and unto the rest in thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of satan, as they speak; i will put upon you none other burden
but that which ye have already hold fast till i come
and he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will i give power over the nations
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers
even as i received of my father
and i will give him the morning star
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
and unto the angel of the church in sardis write; these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god, and the seven stars; i know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead
be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die
for i have not found thy works perfect before god
remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent
if therefore thou shalt not watch, i will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee
thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white
for they are worthy
he that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but i will confess his name before my father, and before his angels
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write; these things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of david, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;
i know thy works
behold, i have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it
for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name
behold, i will make them of the synagogue of satan, which say they are jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, i will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that i have loved thee
because thou hast kept the word of my patience, i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth
behold, i come quickly
hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown
him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god, and he shall go no more out
and i will write upon him the name of my god, and the name of the city of my god, which is new jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my god
and i will write upon him my new name
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write; these things saith the amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of god;
i know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot
i would thou wert cold or hot
so then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, i will spue thee out of my mouth
because thou sayest, i am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked
i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see
as many as i love, i rebuke and chasten
be zealous therefore, and repent
behold, i stand at the door, and knock
if any man hear my voice, and open the door, i will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me
to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne, even as i also overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne
he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches
after this i looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven
and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, come up hither, and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter
and immediately i was in the spirit
and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne
and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone
and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats
and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold
and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices
and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of god
and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal
and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind
and the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle
and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within
and they rest not day and night, saying, holy, holy, holy, lord god almighty, which was, and is, and is to come
and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
thou art worthy, o lord, to receive glory and honour and power
for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created
and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals
and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
and no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon
and i wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon
and one of the elders saith unto me, weep not
behold, the lion of the tribe of juda, the root of david, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof
and i beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne
and when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints
and they sung a new song, saying, thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof
for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
and hast made us unto our god kings and priests
and we shall reign on the earth
and i beheld, and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders
and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
saying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing
and every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard i saying, blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever
and the four beasts said, amen
and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever
and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals, and i heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, come and see
and i saw, and behold a white horse
and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him
and he went forth conquering, and to conquer
and when he had opened the second seal, i heard the second beast say, come and see
and there went out another horse that was red
and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another
and there was given unto him a great sword
and when he had opened the third seal, i heard the third beast say, come and see
and i beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
and when he had opened the fourth seal, i heard the voice of the fourth beast say, come and see
and i looked, and behold a pale horse
and his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him
and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth
and when he had opened the fifth seal, i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god, and for the testimony which they held
and they cried with a loud voice, saying, how long, o lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
and white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled
and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places
and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;
and said to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb
for the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree
and i saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living god
and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
saying, hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads
and i heard the number of them which were sealed
and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel
of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of manasses were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand
after this i beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
and cried with a loud voice, saying, salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb
and all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped god,
saying, amen
blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our god for ever and ever
amen
and one of the elders answered, saying unto me, what are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
and i said unto him, sir, thou knowest
and he said to me, these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the lamb
therefore are they before the throne of god, and serve him day and night in his temple
and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them
they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters
and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
and when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour
and i saw the seven angels which stood before god; and to them were given seven trumpets
and another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne
and the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before god out of the angels hand
and the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth
and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake
and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound
the first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth
and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up
and the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea
and the third part of the sea became blood;
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed
and the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
and the name of the star is called wormwood
and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter
and the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise
and i beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
and the fifth angel sounded, and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth
and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit
and he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth
and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads
and to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months
and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man
and in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men
and they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions
and they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle
and they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails
and their power was to hurt men five months
and they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon, but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon
one woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter
and the sixth angel sounded, and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god,
saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates
and the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men
and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand
and i heard the number of them
and thus i saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone
and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone
by these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths
for their power is in their mouth, and in their tails
for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt
and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood
which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk
neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts
and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud
and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire
and he had in his hand a little book open
and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,
and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth
and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, i was about to write
and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not
and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of god should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
and i went unto the angel, and said unto him, give me the little book
and he said unto me, take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
and i took the little book out of the angels hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
and as soon as i had eaten it, my belly was bitter
and he said unto me, thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings
and there was given me a reed like unto a rod
and the angel stood, saying, rise, and measure the temple of god, and the altar, and them that worship therein
but the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the gentiles
and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months
and i will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth
these are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth
and if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies
and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed
these have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy
and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will
and when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called sodom and egypt, where also our lord was crucified
and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth
and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them
and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, come up hither
and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them
and the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand
and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the god of heaven
the second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly
and the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord, and of his christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever
and the four and twenty elders, which sat before god on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped god,
saying, we give thee thanks, o lord god almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned
and the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth
and the temple of god was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament
and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail
and there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars
and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered
and there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth
and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born
and she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron
and her child was caught up unto god, and to his throne
and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of god, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days
and there was war in heaven
michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven
and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and satan, which deceiveth the whole world
he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him
and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven, now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our god, and the power of his christ
for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our god day and night
and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death
therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them
woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time
and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child
and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent
and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood
and the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth
and the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of god, and have the testimony of jesus christ
and i stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion
and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority
and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed
and all the world wondered after the beast
and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast
and they worshipped the beast, saying, who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months
and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven
and it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them
and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world
if any man have an ear, let him hear
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity
he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword
here is the patience and the faith of the saints
and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed
and he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed
and he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads
and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name
here is wisdom
let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast
for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six
and i looked, and, lo, a lamb stood on the mount sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his fathers name written in their foreheads
and i heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder
and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders
and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth
these are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins
these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth
these were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb
and in their mouth was found no guile
for they are without fault before the throne of god
and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
saying with a loud voice, fear god, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come
and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters
and there followed another angel, saying, babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication
and the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, if any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the lamb
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever
and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name
here is the patience of the saints
here are they that keep the commandments of god, and the faith of jesus
and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, write, blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth
yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them
and i looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle
and another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, thrust in thy sickle, and reap
for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle
and another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe
and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god
and the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs
and i saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of god
and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire
and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of god
and they sing the song of moses the servant of god, and the song of the lamb, saying, great and marvellous are thy works, lord god almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou king of saints
who shall not fear thee, o lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy
for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest
and after that i looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god, who liveth for ever and ever
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled
and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth
and the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man
and every living soul died in the sea
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood
and i heard the angel of the waters say, thou art righteous, o lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus
for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy
and i heard another out of the altar say, even so, lord god almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire
and men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of god, which hath power over these plagues
and they repented not to give him glory
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared
and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet
for they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty
behold, i come as a thief
blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame
and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon
and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, it is done
and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great
and the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell
and great babylon came in remembrance before god, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath
and every island fled away, and the mountains were not found
and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent
and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, come hither; i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication
so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness
and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns
and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
and upon her forehead was a name written, mystery, babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth
and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus
and when i saw her, i wondered with great admiration
and the angel said unto me, wherefore didst thou marvel? i will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns
the beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition
and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is
and here is the mind which hath wisdom
the seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth
and there are seven kings
five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space
and the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition
and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast
these have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast
these shall make war with the lamb, and the lamb shall overcome them
for he is lord of lords, and king of kings
and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful
and he saith unto me, the waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire
for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of god shall be fulfilled
and the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth
and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory
and he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies
and i heard another voice from heaven, saying, come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues
for her sins have reached unto heaven, and god hath remembered her iniquities
reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works
in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double
how much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her
for she saith in her heart, i sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow
therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire
for strong is the lord god who judgeth her
and the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, alas, alas, that great city babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come
and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more
the merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men
and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all
the merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
and saying, alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
for in one hour so great riches is come to nought
and every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, what city is like unto this great city!
and they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate
rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for god hath avenged you on her
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all
and the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee
for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived
and in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth
and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, alleluia; salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the lord our god
for true and righteous are his judgments
for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand
and again they said, alleluia
and her smoke rose up for ever and ever
and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne, saying, amen; alleluia
and a voice came out of the throne, saying, praise our god, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great
and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, alleluia
for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him
for the marriage of the lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready
and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white
for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints
and he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb
and he saith unto me, these are the true sayings of god
and i fell at his feet to worship him
and he said unto me, see thou do it not
i am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus
worship god
for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
and i saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war
his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself
and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood
and his name is called the word of god
and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean
and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron
and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, king of kings, and lord of lords
and i saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god;
that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great
and i saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army
and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image
these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone
and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth
and all the fowls were filled with their flesh
and i saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand
and he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and satan, and bound him a thousand years,
and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled
and after that he must be loosed a little season
and i saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them
and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus, and for the word of god, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years
but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished
this is the first resurrection
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection
on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of god and of christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years
and when the thousand years are expired, satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, gog and magog, to gather them together to battle
the number of whom is as the sand of the sea
and they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city
and fire came down from god out of heaven, and devoured them
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever
and i saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them
and i saw the dead, small and great, stand before god; and the books were opened
and another book was opened, which is the book of life
and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them
and they were judged every man according to their works
and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire
this is the second death
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea
and i john saw the holy city, new jerusalem, coming down from god out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying, behold, the tabernacle of god is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and god himself shall be with them, and be their god
and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain
for the former things are passed away
and he that sat upon the throne said, behold, i make all things new
and he said unto me, write
for these words are true and faithful
and he said unto me, it is done
i am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end
i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely
he that overcometh shall inherit all things; and i will be his god, and he shall be my son
but the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone
which is the second death
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, come hither, i will shew thee the bride, the lambs wife
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy jerusalem, descending out of heaven from god,
having the glory of god
and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
and had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel
on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates
and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof
and the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth
and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs
the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal
and he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel
and the building of the wall of it was of jasper
and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass
and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones
the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl
and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass
and i saw no temple therein
for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it
and the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it
for the glory of god did lighten it, and the lamb is the light thereof
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it
and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it
and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day
for there shall be no night there
and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie
but they which are written in the lambs book of life
and he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb
in the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month
and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations
and there shall be no more curse
but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him
and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads
and there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the lord god giveth them light
and they shall reign for ever and ever
and he said unto me, these sayings are faithful and true
and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done
behold, i come quickly
blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book
and i john saw these things, and heard them
and when i had heard and seen, i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things
then saith he unto me, see thou do it not
for i am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book
worship god
and he saith unto me, seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book
for the time is at hand
he that is unjust, let him be unjust still
and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still
and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still
and he that is holy, let him be holy still
and, behold, i come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be
i am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last
blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city
for without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches
i am the root and the offspring of david, and the bright and morning star
and the spirit and the bride say, come
and let him that heareth say, come
and let him that is athirst come
and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely
for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto these things, god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, god shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book
he which testifieth these things saith, surely i come quickly
amen
even so, come, lord jesus
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all
amen
