## Leveraging Bitext mining and COMET-QE for improving parallel data selection of low-resource machine translation
One of the major challenges of low-resource machine translation is the quality of parallel data used to train the models. Previous works has shown that by improving the quality of sentence transformer models used for bitext mining and additional selection using COMET quality estimation models, we can improve the quality of parallel data, and thus the resulting machine translation models [1][2]. We will demonstrate these approaches on a few low-resource African languages such as Somali, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Kinyarwanda and Zulu.
